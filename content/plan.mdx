# The 99% Reset — The Plan

**Purpose:** Make the top 1% politically and economically irrelevant within a generation—non-violently—by shifting ownership and bargaining power to workers and communities.

---

## Executive Summary

The 99% Reset is a coordinated, non-violent movement to reverse 40 years of upward wealth concentration by building parallel economic institutions that make billionaires and corporate extraction obsolete. We don't protest for change—we **become** the change through three phases:

<ColoredSection color="accent">

### Phase 1 (Years 1-4): Starve the Parasite
- Move $150B from Big 5 banks to credit unions
- Launch 1,200 union drives in strategic sectors
- Boycott billionaire-tied brands

### Phase 2 (Years 4-8): Flood the Zone
- Create 2,000 worker cooperatives
- Secure 50,000 homes in Community Land Trusts
- Pass wealth taxes generating $10B annually
- Establish Citizens' Wealth Fund

### Phase 3 (Years 8-20): Make Wealth Worthless
- Fund dividend of $500-$2,000 per citizen annually
- Shift 40% of market to democratic ownership
- Reduce top 1% wealth share from 25% to 10%

</ColoredSection>

<Callout type="success">

This is not utopian—it's based on proven models: Sweden's Meidner Plan, Québec's co-op economy, Alaska's Permanent Fund, and Vermont's CLT network. **The difference:** We coordinate all tactics simultaneously, creating cascading disruption billionaires can't counter.

## Why Now? Historical Context

### The Debt Supercycle (1979-2025)

Since 1979, three structural shifts created our crisis:

<Stats>
  <Stat value="25%" label="Top 1% share of wealth in Canada (was 8% in 1980)" icon="trending" />
  <Stat value="+350%" label="Housing price increase (1979-2024) while wages rose only 40%" icon="target" />
  <Stat value="$2.3T" label="Household debt (175% of disposable income)" icon="trending" />
</Stats>

<ColoredSection color="darker">

**1. Wealth Concentration**
- Top 1% share rose from 8% (1980) to 25% (2024) in Canada
- Bottom 50% wealth share fell from 6% to 2%
- Median wage growth: +0.3%/year vs. GDP growth: +2.1%/year

**2. Asset Bubbles**
- Housing prices: +350% (1979-2024) vs. wages: +40%
- Stock market: +1,200% while labour's GDP share fell 7 points
- Corporate profits: 12% of GDP (highest since 1929)

**3. Debt Dependence**
- Household debt: $2.3 trillion (175% of disposable income)
- Workers borrow to afford housing/education/healthcare
- Interest payments enrich creditors (the 1%)

</ColoredSection>

<Callout type="warning">

**The Pattern:** Billionaires extract wages → Workers borrow → Debt service enriches billionaires → Repeat until crash (1929, 2008, 2025?).

</Callout>

<Highlight>

**The Solution:** Break the cycle by moving money, organizing labour, and owning assets collectively.

## Theory of Change: Three Simultaneous Fronts

Traditional movements fail because they attack **one** lever: either protest (symbolic), electoral politics (slow), or mutual aid (small-scale). The Reset coordinates **three** fronts:

<ColoredSection color="dark">

### Front 1: Withdrawal of Consent
- Move deposits, boycott brands, quit exploitative jobs
- **Effect:** Crashes billionaire asset values and credit ratings

### Front 2: Counter-Institutions
- Build co-ops, CLTs, credit unions, wealth funds
- **Effect:** Creates viable alternatives to capitalism

### Front 3: Policy Capture
- Win wealth taxes, labour reforms, co-op subsidies
- **Effect:** Locks in gains, scales institutions

</ColoredSection>

<Callout type="info">

**Why it works:** Billionaires can handle protests (ignore), elections (buy), or co-ops (niche). They can't handle **all three** eroding their power base simultaneously. 

**Example:** A bank boycott (-$10B deposits) triggers credit rating review, which regulators investigate, which fuels policy momentum for wealth taxes.

</Callout>

## 1. Finance: Starving the Financial Extraction Machine

<div id="finance"></div>

### The Problem: Banks as Wealth Concentration Engines

Canada's Big 5 banks (RBC, TD, BMO, Scotiabank, CIBC) don't serve the economy—they extract from it:

**Fossil Fuel Financing:** $900 billion since 2016 (Rainforest Action Network)
- Loans to oil sands, LNG, pipelines → climate crisis + billionaire profits
- Example: RBC financed $268 billion; CEO Dave McKay earned $16M in 2024

**Offshore Havens:** $682 billion hidden (C4TF 2025)
- Thomson, Gilgan, Pattison use Bermuda/Cayman subsidiaries
- Lost tax revenue: $3.65 billion annually

**Speculative Lending:** $2.3 trillion in household debt
- Mortgages at 5-7% interest enrich shareholders while workers pay 40% of income to housing
- Big 5 profit: $56 billion in 2024 (record high)

**Cantillon Effect:** When central banks print money, banks get it first
- Banks lend to rich (assets appreciate); workers get inflation last
- Result: Asset bubbles (housing +350%) while wages stagnate (+40% since 1979)

### The Solution: Credit Union Migration + Citizens' Wealth Fund

**Phase 1: Bank Boycott (Years 1-4)**

Move deposits to **credit unions** (member-owned, democratic, divested from fossil fuels):

<Callout type="tip">

### 30-Day Action Plan
1. Open account at local credit union (Vancity, Desjardins, Alterna)
2. Redirect direct deposits (payroll, benefits)
3. Transfer pre-authorized payments (rent, utilities)
4. Close Big 5 accounts after 2 payroll cycles

</Callout>

</Stats>

<Callout type="info">

**Historical Precedent:** 2017 #DeleteFacebook moved 10 million users in 3 months. Banks are **more vulnerable** than tech because ratings determine loan costs—deposit flight triggers cascading losses.

</Callout>

**Phase 2: Citizens' Wealth Fund (Years 4-8)**

Once we've proven bank boycott power, **legislate** a public wealth fund:

**Revenue Sources:**
1. **Wealth Tax:** 1-2% annually on net worth &gt;$10M
   - Canadian revenue: $5.6 billion/year (PBO 2025)
   - Targets: 61 billionaires with $324 billion

2. **Speculation & Vacancy Tax:** 3-5% on empty homes/commercial
   - BC model: $90 million/year from 1% tax
   - Scaled nationally: $2-3 billion/year

3. **Financial Transaction Tax:** 0.1% on stock/bond trades
   - Revenue: $5-8 billion/year (C4TF estimate)
   - Reduces high-frequency speculation

4. **Offshore Crackdown:** Close Bermuda/Cayman loopholes
   - Recovered revenue: $3.65 billion/year

**Total Fund Growth:** $10-20 billion annually by year 5

**Governance (Alaska/Norway Model):**
- **Board:** 7 members (3 public, 2 worker co-op reps, 2 economists)
- **Management:** Professional (not politicians—prevents corruption)
- **Dividend Formula:** 4-5% of fund value annually
- **Distribution:** Equal per-capita (prevents means-testing bureaucracy)

**Dividend Timeline:**
- **Year 3:** $50/person (fund at $30 billion)
- **Year 5:** $200/person (fund at $100 billion)
- **Year 10:** $500/person (fund at $250 billion)
- **Year 20:** $2,000/person (fund at $1 trillion)

**Why This Works:**
- **Alaska Permanent Fund:** $78 billion; pays $1,000-$2,000/year since 1982
- **Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund:** $1.6 trillion; funds pensions, infrastructure
- **Reset Innovation:** We fund it via wealth confiscation, not oil (moral + sustainable)

### Advanced: Helicopter Money (Phase 3)

Once fund is established, **bypass banks** for stimulus:

**The Problem:** Central bank stimulus goes to banks first (Cantillon effect)
- 2020 COVID stimulus: $500 billion created → banks lent to rich → asset inflation
- Workers got crumbs; billionaires got $100 billion richer

**The Fix:** Direct deposits from Wealth Fund during recessions
- Example: 2008 crisis → $2,000/person × 40 million = $80 billion directly to consumers
- Stimulates demand (workers spend, not hoard like rich)
- Bypasses bank markup (no interest extraction)

**Precedent:** COVID CERB ($2,000/month) kept economy afloat; Reset makes it permanent + funded by billionaires.

### Key Metrics
- **Year 3:** $10B moved to credit unions; $500M fund contributions
- **Year 5:** $50B moved; $2B fund contributions; $200/person dividend
- **Year 10:** $150B moved; $10B fund contributions; $500/person dividend
- **Year 20:** $1 trillion fund; $2,000/person dividend

---

## 2. Ownership: From Extraction to Equity

<div id="ownership"></div>

### The Problem: Ownership Apartheid

In Canada, **ownership** is the ultimate power—yet it's monopolized:

**Worker Exclusion:**
- Workers create 100% of value but own 0% of equity in most firms
- Owners/shareholders extract profits without contributing labour
- Example: Loblaws' Weston family net worth $10B; cashiers earn $16/hour with no ownership

**Housing Financialization:**
- Homes treated as speculative assets, not shelter
- BlackRock, Gilgan, Wilson own thousands of units; flip for profit
- Result: 350% price increase (1979-2024); homeownership rate fell from 69% to 66%

**Generational Wealth Lock:**
- Parents can't pass homes to kids at affordable prices (market resets to speculation)
- Co-ops/CLTs solve this: intergenerational affordability via resale caps

**Democratic Deficit:**
- Shareholders vote on company strategy; workers have zero voice
- Oligarchs (Thomson, Pattison) control media, construction, retail—accountable to no one

### The Solution: Ownership Tsunami via Co-ops + CLTs

**Worker Co-ops: Democracy at Work**

A **worker cooperative** is a business owned and controlled by its employees. Proven model:

**Québec Example:**
- 10,000 co-ops; 200,000 worker-owners
- Survival rate: 62% vs. 35% for conventional startups
- Wage premium: 15-20% higher than non-union equivalents
- Profit-sharing: Average 20-30% of salary as annual dividend

**Mondragon (Spain):**
- 80,000 worker-owners; $12 billion revenue
- Wage ratio (CEO:lowest): 6:1 vs. 300:1 in corporations
- Zero layoffs during 2008 crisis (reduced hours democratically instead)

**Reset Timeline:**

**Years 1-4: Incubation (300 co-ops)**
1. **Canadian Worker Co-op Federation (CWCF):** Scale JEDDI grants from $50K to $500K/co-op
2. **Sector Focus:** Tech, care work, retail (high-exploitation, easy to organize)
3. **Succession Co-ops:** Target retiring small business owners (40% of businesses by 2030)
   - Example: Owner sells to employees at discount; gets tax break + legacy

**Years 4-8: Growth (800 co-ops)**
1. **Wealth Fund Financing:** $500M co-op development bank
   - Loans at 3-5% interest (vs. 7-10% commercial)
2. **Provincial Incentives:** Tax credits for worker equity (Colorado model: 2% annual equity mandate)
3. **Union-to-Co-op Pipeline:** Unionized shops transition to worker ownership
   - Example: United Steelworkers' "Union Co-op" model (30 conversions since 2012)

**Years 8-20: Scale (2,000+ co-ops)**
1. **Mandatory Equity:** Firms &gt;50 employees must offer 20% worker ownership
2. **CLT-Co-op Integration:** Co-ops lease land from CLTs (affordable rent, community anchor)
3. **Federations:** Sector-specific co-op federations (like Mondragon) for shared services, capital

**Community Land Trusts: Permanent Affordable Housing**

A **CLT** is a nonprofit that owns land and leases it to residents, capping resale prices forever.

**How It Works:**
- CLT buys land ($300K) via grants/bonds
- Resident buys house only ($200K vs. $800K market)
- Lease fee to CLT: $50-$150/month (covers land taxes)
- Resale formula: Homeowner keeps 25% of appreciation
  - Example: House appreciates to $300K → Resale at $225K → Next buyer still gets affordability

**Burlington VT Model (40 years proven):**
- 565 CLT homes; zero foreclosures during 2008 crisis
- Homeowners build $20K-$40K equity over 10 years (enough for down payment on next home)
- Permanent affordability: Homes stay 40-50% below market in perpetuity

**Reset Timeline:**

**Years 1-4: Pilot (5,000 units)**
1. **Municipal Land Donations:** Vancouver, Toronto, Montréal donate surplus lots
2. **Speculation Tax Revenue:** BC's $90M/year → CLT land acquisition
3. **Community Bonds:** Crowdfund $100M from residents at 3-5% interest (vs. 0.5% savings account)

**Years 4-8: Scale (20,000 units)**
1. **Federal Co-Investment:** CMHC matches municipal/provincial CLT funding dollar-for-dollar
2. **Vacancy Tax Seizures:** 500% tax forces Fidani/Pattison to sell vacant lots to CLTs
3. **Inclusionary Zoning:** 20% of new developments must be CLT (Portland OR precedent)

**Years 8-20: Institutionalization (50,000+ units)**
1. **Right of First Refusal:** CLTs get first option to buy any property in designated zones
2. **Land Value Tax:** Replace property tax with tax on unimproved land → incentivizes development, funds CLTs
3. **Agricultural CLTs:** Secure farmland from speculation (food sovereignty + climate)

### Key Metrics
- **Year 3:** 300 worker co-ops; 5,000 CLT units; 10,000 worker-owners
- **Year 5:** 800 co-ops; 20,000 CLT units; 30,000 worker-owners
- **Year 10:** 2,000 co-ops; 50,000 CLT units; 100,000 worker-owners
- **Year 20:** 5,000+ co-ops; 150,000 CLT units; 300,000 worker-owners

**Impact:** 40% of economy democratically owned; top 1% wealth share drops from 25% to 15%.

## 3. Labour: Restoring Bargaining Power

<div id="labour"></div>

### The Problem: 40 Years of Wage Theft

**Labour's GDP Share Collapse:**
- 1979: Labour earned 56% of GDP
- 2024: Labour earns 49% of GDP (7-point drop)
- **Translation:** $200 billion annually shifted from wages to profits/capital

**Where Did It Go?**
- **Executive Pay:** CEO:worker ratio rose from 20:1 (1979) to 300:1 (2024)
  - Example: Loblaws CEO earned $11.8M (2023); cashiers $16/hour = 0.003% of CEO
- **Shareholder Returns:** Stock buybacks ($500B since 2010) vs. wage increases ($50B)
- **Rent Extraction:** Billionaires own assets (real estate, IP, monopolies); workers pay rents

**Union Decline:**
- 1981: 38% unionization rate
- 2024: 28% unionization rate
- **Result:** Non-union workers lost 20% bargaining power; wages decoupled from productivity

**Why Unions Matter:**
- **Union Wage Premium:** $5.40/hour average (StatsCan 2024)
- **Spillover Effect:** 10% unionization increase raises **all** wages 3-4% (threat of unionization forces non-union employers to compete)
- **Political Power:** Unions fund progressive campaigns, block anti-labour laws

### The Solution: Strategic Unionization + Labour Law Reform

**Phase 1: Sectoral Targeting (Years 1-4, 100 drives)**

Focus on **high-leverage sectors** where unionization creates cascading effects:

**1. Tech (Amazon, Google, Apple):**
- **Why:** 100,000+ Canadian workers; low unionization (5%); public sympathy
- **Tactic:** Tech Workers Coalition model (worker-led, social justice framing)
- **Impact:** Unionizing Amazon warehouses (30K workers) adds $150M to wages annually
- **Precedent:** Amazon JFK8 (NYC) unionized 2022; Starbucks' 400+ stores (2020-2025)

**2. Retail (Walmart, Loblaws, Couche-Tard):**
- **Why:** 500,000+ workers; poverty wages ($16/hour); high turnover
- **Tactic:** UFCW "blitz" campaigns (organize 10 stores simultaneously; overwhelm employer)
- **Impact:** Unionizing Loblaws (200K workers) shifts $2B from Westons to workers over 10 years
- **Precedent:** Québec grocery stores (Métro, IGA) 80% unionized; $3/hour premium

**3. Care Work (Nursing homes, child care, home care):**
- **Why:** 400,000+ workers; female-dominated; underpaid ($18/hour for life-or-death work)
- **Tactic:** SEIU "Justice for Janitors" model (community coalitions, civil disobedience)
- **Impact:** Unionizing care sector adds $3B to wages; improves patient/client outcomes
- **Precedent:** Cooperative Home Care Associates (Bronx): 2,000 worker-owners; $18→$25/hour + benefits

**4. Logistics (FedEx, UPS, trucking):**
- **Why:** 200,000+ workers; essential (can shut down economy); misclassified as contractors
- **Tactic:** Teamsters "hot cargo" (refuse to handle non-union goods)
- **Impact:** Unionizing logistics forces Amazon/Walmart to accept unions (supply chain leverage)
- **Precedent:** 1997 UPS strike won 10,000 full-time jobs; 2024 UPS contract: $7.50/hour raise

**90-Day Organizing Timeline (Per Drive):**
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Identify 5-10 leaders; secret first meeting off-site
2. **Weeks 3-8:** One-on-one conversations; sign union cards (target 60%+ for safety margin)
3. **Week 9:** File for certification with Labour Board
4. **Weeks 10-12:** Counter employer union-busting; win vote (50%+1)
5. **Months 4-12:** Bargain first contract; strike if needed (72% settle without strikes)

**Phase 2: Labour Law Reform (Years 2-5)**

Unionizing is hard under current laws—employer intimidation legal, delays common. We need **card-check** and **first-contract arbitration**:

**Card-Check Certification:**
- **Current (most provinces):** Sign 40-50% → triggers vote (5-10 days later); employer holds captive-audience meetings, fires leaders
- **Reform:** Sign 55%+ → **auto-certification** (no vote, no employer interference)
- **Precedent:** BC (2019), Québec (always had); union density 10 points higher than Alberta/Ontario

**First-Contract Arbitration:**
- **Current:** Employer can stall bargaining for years; union decertifies from frustration
- **Reform:** If no contract after 120 days → government arbitrator imposes one
- **Precedent:** BC, Québec; first-contract win rate 90% vs. 60% in Alberta

**Sectoral Bargaining:**
- **Current:** Each workplace negotiates separately; Walmart can undercut unionized Target
- **Reform:** Industry-wide contracts (e.g., all retail in province); raises floor for everyone
- **Precedent:** Germany (90% coverage); Québec construction (40,000 workers, province-wide contract)

**Ban Replacement Workers:**
- **Current:** Employers hire scabs during strikes; defeats purpose of withholding labour
- **Reform:** Illegal to replace strikers (forces negotiation)
- **Precedent:** Québec (since 1977); BC (2024); strikes shorter, settlements better

**How We Win These:**
1. **Phase 1 momentum:** 100 successful drives → media coverage → public support (89% Canadians support card-check per C4TF poll)
2. **NDP leverage:** Minority government → condition support on labour law reform
3. **Ballot initiatives:** BC/ON allow citizen-initiated referendums (bypass legislature)

**Phase 3: Union-to-Co-op Pipeline (Years 5-10)**

Once workplaces are unionized, **transition to worker ownership**:

**United Steelworkers "Union Co-op" Model:**
- Union negotiates for equity stake (2% annually)
- After 10 years → workers own 20%; vote on board
- After 25 years → workers own 51%; full democratic control

**Why This Works:**
- **Unions alone:** Bargain wages but owners still extract profits
- **Co-ops alone:** Small-scale, lack leverage
- **Union Co-ops:** Best of both—collective bargaining + ownership

**Precedent:**
- **Cincinnati Union Co-op Initiative:** 10 conversions since 2018 (laundries, landscaping, home care)
- **Mondragon:** Started as union; transitioned to full co-op (80,000 worker-owners)
- **Italy:** 30% of GDP in co-ops (Emilia-Romagna region); highest wages in Europe

### Key Metrics
- **Year 3:** 100 union drives launched; 30,000 new union members; labour's GDP share +1 point
- **Year 5:** 500 drives; 150,000 new members; +3 points; card-check in BC/QC
- **Year 10:** 1,200 drives; 500,000 new members; +5 points; 300 union co-ops
- **Year 20:** Labour's GDP share restored to 54% (1985 level); $150B annually to workers

---

## 4. Policy: Locking In Grassroots Wins

<div id="policy"></div>

Grassroots action builds power, but **policy** makes it permanent. Without legislation:
- Credit unions face regulatory capture by Big 5-friendly bureaucrats
- Co-ops lack startup capital (no federal equivalent to US SBA co-op loans)
- CLTs can't scale (municipalities hoard surplus land for developer buddies)

**The Strategy:** Use grassroots victories (100 union drives, 10,000 bank switchers) to **demand** policy. Politicians respond to organized constituents + public pressure.

### Three-Level Campaign (Municipal → Provincial → Federal)

**Municipal (Easiest, Years 1-3)**

Target progressive councils (Vancouver, Toronto, Montréal) with **direct asks:**

1. **Vacancy Taxes (500% on empty homes/commercial)**
   - BC precedent: Vancouver Empty Homes Tax raised $76M (2017-2024)
   - Reset demand: 500% rate (vs. 1-3% current); revenue to CLTs
   - Impact: Fidani/Pattison forced to sell vacant lots at discount to CLTs

2. **CLT Land Donations**
   - Cities own 10-15% of land (surplus schools, parking lots, parks departments)
   - Demand: Donate 5% to CLTs over 10 years
   - Impact: 10,000 CLT homes without taxpayer cost

3. **Living Wage Ordinances ($25/hour for city contractors)**
   - Precedent: 70+ US cities; Toronto living wage $25.05 (2024)
   - Demand: All city contracts require $25/hour + benefits
   - Impact: 50,000 workers; raises floor for private sector

4. **Co-op Zoning Preferences**
   - Fast-track permits for worker co-ops (6 months vs. 18 months)
   - Waive development fees for CLTs
   - Impact: 100 co-ops/CLTs launched over 5 years per city

**Provincial (Medium, Years 2-5)**

Target NDP/Green governments (BC, future QC/ON):

1. **Wealth Tax (1-2% on net worth &gt;$10M)**
   - BC potential: $2-3 billion/year (C4TF estimate)
   - Precedent: Spain regional wealth taxes; NDP 2025 federal platform (66.7% capital gains inclusion)
   - Reset demand: 1% on $10M-$50M; 2% on &gt;$50M; revenue to Wealth Fund

2. **Speculation & Vacancy Tax Expansion**
   - BC SVT: $90M/year from 13 municipalities
   - Demand: Expand to all cities &gt;50K population; raise rate to 3-5%
   - Impact: $500M/year → 5,000 CLT homes annually

3. **Card-Check Unionization**
   - BC/QC have 55% auto-certification; AB/ON need 40% + vote
   - Demand: 55% auto-certification nationally
   - Impact: Union density +10 points over 10 years (300,000 new members)

4. **Worker Co-op Incentives**
   - Tax credits: 20% of investment in worker equity (Colorado model)
   - Grants: $500K/co-op for startups (scale CWCF JEDDI)
   - Impact: 500 co-ops over 5 years per province

5. **CLT Acquisition Funds**
   - Dedicated 10% of affordable housing budgets to CLTs
   - BC Housing: $19B over 10 years → $1.9B to CLTs = 10,000 units
   - Impact: Permanent affordability vs. temporary subsidies

**Federal (Hardest, Years 3-7)**

Leverage NDP minority government (condition support on Reset policies):

1. **Capital Gains Reform (100% inclusion, no exemptions)**
   - Current: 50% inclusion (billionaires pay 26% vs. workers' 33%)
   - NDP 2025: 66.7% inclusion
   - Reset demand: 100% (capital = income; tax equally)
   - Impact: $8 billion/year revenue

2. **Offshore Haven Crackdown**
   - Close Bermuda/Cayman loopholes (require economic substance)
   - CRA audits of Thomson/Gilgan/Bouchard subsidiaries
   - Impact: $3.65 billion/year recovered

3. **Co-op Development Bank ($1B fund)**
   - Loans at 3-5% interest (vs. 7-10% commercial)
   - Modeled on US SBA co-op loans (funded Cooperative Home Care Associates)
   - Impact: 1,000 co-ops over 10 years

4. **Citizens' Wealth Fund (Financial Transaction Tax)**
   - 0.1% on stock/bond trades
   - Revenue: $5-8 billion/year (C4TF estimate)
   - Governance: 7-member board (3 public, 2 labour, 2 economists); dividend formula 4-5% annually

5. **CMHC CLT Co-Investment**
   - Match provincial/municipal CLT funding dollar-for-dollar
   - Impact: Double CLT scale (40,000 units over 10 years)

6. **First-Contract Arbitration (Federal Jurisdiction)**
   - Applies to 10% of workers (banking, telecoms, federal workers)
   - Precedent: BC/QC; first-contract win rate 90%
   - Impact: 50,000 federal workers win first contracts

### How We Win Policy: 12-Month Campaign Template

**Month 1-3: Coalition + Research**
1. Build 20-org coalition (unions, tenant unions, churches, students)
2. Research precedents (BC SVT, Burlington CLT, German sectoral bargaining)
3. Draft template legislation (one-pager, full bill, fiscal analysis)

**Month 4-6: Public Education**
1. Petition: 10,000 signatures (shows public support)
2. Town halls: 5 public meetings (union halls, libraries)
3. Media: Op-eds, social media blitz, infographics

**Month 7-9: Direct Lobbying**
1. Book meetings with councillors/MLAs/MPs (bring 3-5 constituents)
2. Testify at committee hearings (5-min presentation)
3. Inside game: Allies introduce motion/bill

**Month 10-12: Mobilization + Vote**
1. Rally: 500+ at city hall/legislature
2. Vote tracking: Call undecided daily
3. Win or lose: If pass, celebrate + enforce; if fail, target elections

**Precedent:** 2017-2019 BC rent control campaign (ACORN + unions) won vacancy control via this exact playbook.

### Key Metrics
- **Year 2:** 10 municipalities pass vacancy taxes; 3 provinces explore wealth taxes
- **Year 3:** BC passes $2B/year wealth tax; federal card-check for federal workers
- **Year 5:** 30 municipalities; 5 provinces; federal capital gains 100%; Co-op Bank launched
- **Year 7:** Citizens' Wealth Fund established ($10B/year revenue); 40,000 CLT units nationally

## Historical Precedents: Proof It Works

Critics call the Reset "utopian." History proves otherwise—every tactic has precedent:

### Sweden's Meidner Plan (1976-1983)

**What:** Swedish unions proposed "wage-earner funds"—2% of corporate profits annually transferred to worker-owned funds.

**Result:** 
- Partial implementation (watered down by capital flight threats)
- Still created $10 billion worker fund by 1990s
- Inspired modern wealth fund proposals

**Lessons:** Go bigger, faster; don't give billionaires time to flee.

### Québec Co-op Economy (1970s-Present)

**What:** Provincial support for co-ops (Desjardins credit unions, worker co-ops, housing co-ops).

**Result:**
- 10,000+ co-ops; 200,000 worker-owners
- $40 billion in co-op GDP (12% of provincial economy)
- Highest wages in Canada (outside oil provinces)

**Lessons:** Government support scales co-ops; Québec model proves viability.

### Alaska Permanent Fund (1976-Present)

**What:** 25% of oil revenue → sovereign wealth fund; 4-5% dividend to residents annually.

**Result:**
- $78 billion fund (2024)
- $1,000-$2,000/year dividend since 1982
- Reduced poverty 20%; Alaska has 2nd-lowest inequality in US

**Lessons:** Universal dividend works; Alaska funded by oil, we fund by wealth tax (moral upgrade).

### Burlington Community Land Trust (1984-Present)

**What:** Nonprofit buys land, leases to residents; resale formula caps appreciation.

**Result:**
- 565 CLT homes; zero foreclosures in 2008
- Homes 40-50% below market in perpetuity
- Model replicated in 300+ US cities

**Lessons:** CLTs work at scale; need municipal support + seed capital.

### Mondragon Corporation (Spain, 1956-Present)

**What:** Catholic priest started co-op; scaled to 80,000 worker-owners.

**Result:**
- $12 billion revenue; #1 employer in Basque region
- CEO:worker pay ratio 6:1 (vs. 300:1 in corporations)
- Zero layoffs during 2008 crisis

**Lessons:** Co-ops can scale to Fortune 500 size; democratic governance is competitive.

### Post-WW2 Compression (1945-1979)

**What:** High taxes (90% top rate), strong unions (35% density), GI Bill housing.

**Result:**
- Middle class wealth share rose from 30% (1940) to 60% (1979)
- Top 1% share fell from 45% to 20%
- GDP growth 3.5%/year (fastest in US/Canadian history)

**Lessons:** We've done this before; billionaire wealth is **not** necessary for prosperity.

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Capital Flight**

**Threat:** Billionaires flee to Dubai/Singapore; take wealth with them.

**Mitigation:**
- **Exit Taxes:** 25% of net worth on renouncing citizenship (proposed by Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders)
- **Coordinated Action:** #99ResetUS, #99ResetEU launch simultaneously (fewer havens)
- **Asset Seizures:** Thomson's media empire, Pattison's car dealerships can't move; seize via eminent domain if they flee

**Precedent:** France tried wealth tax alone (1980s); billionaires fled. **But** Norway kept wealth tax + exit tax → works fine.

**Risk 2: Media Smear Campaign**

**Threat:** Thomson owns Globe & Mail; Pattison owns radio/TV; they vilify the Reset as "communism."

**Mitigation:**
- **Alternative Media:** Fund Ricochet, Passage, Canadaland (co-op journalism)
- **Social Media:** TikTok, Instagram bypass corporate gatekeepers (60% of under-40s get news here)
- **Testimonials:** Highlight **workers** who benefited (harder to smear a nurse than a "radical organizer")

**Precedent:** Starbucks spent $10M on union-busting PR; 400+ stores still unionized via worker testimonials.

**Risk 3: Legal Backlash**

**Threat:** Billionaires sue wealth taxes/CLTs as "unconstitutional takings."

**Mitigation:**
- **Provincial Jurisdiction:** Wealth/property taxes are provincial power (feds can't overrule)
- **Democratic Legitimacy:** If 70% vote for it, courts hesitate (Québec's Bill 21 precedent)
- **Legal Defense Fund:** Pool $5M from unions/Reset chapters for Supreme Court fights

**Precedent:** BC's SVT survived legal challenge (2020); courts deferred to democratic will.

**Risk 4: Economic Slowdown**

**Threat:** "Taxing billionaires will crash the economy!" (Chamber of Commerce talking point)

**Counter-Evidence:**
- **Historical:** 1945-1979 had 90% top tax rate + fastest growth
- **International:** Norway/Sweden have wealth taxes + higher GDP/capita than Canada
- **Logic:** Workers **spend** money (stimulates economy); billionaires **hoard** (dead capital)

**Mitigation:**
- **Start Small:** BC wealth tax first (prove it works); then scale nationally
- **Helicopter Money:** If recession hits, Wealth Fund deposits $2K/person (Keynesian stimulus)

**Risk 5: Cooption/Watering Down**

**Threat:** Politicians promise Reset policies, then deliver neoliberal-lite (e.g., Trudeau's "middle class prosperity").

**Mitigation:**
- **Binding Referendums:** Force politicians to sign enforceable pledges (e.g., "I will vote yes on wealth tax or face recall")
- **Independent Chapters:** Don't endorse parties; endorse **policies** (non-partisan power)
- **Transparency:** Publish scorecards (who voted how); primary opponents who betrayed pledges

**Precedent:** Justice Democrats (US) primaried 12 corporate Democrats 2018-2022; won 7 seats.

**Risk 6: Burnout/Movement Fatigue**

**Threat:** Organizing is hard; people quit after 1-2 years.

**Mitigation:**
- **Rotate Leadership:** Term limits (no one stays coordinator &gt;2 years); prevents personality cults
- **Celebrate Wins:** Every 100 bank switchers = party; every union win = press conference
- **Mutual Aid:** Chapters provide childcare, meals, rides (reduce logistical barriers)

**Precedent:** Civil Rights Movement sustained 15 years via "freedom schools," mass meetings, culture (songs, rituals).

## International Coordination: #99ResetGlobal

Billionaire wealth is **global**—so is the Reset:

### Parallel Launches

- **#99ResetUS:** Target Musk ($250B), Bezos ($180B), Zuckerberg ($150B) using same tactics (bank boycotts, union drives, wealth taxes)
- **#99ResetEU:** France/Germany/Spain coordinate wealth taxes (prevent flight to Monaco)
- **#99ResetUK:** Focus on City of London (offshore haven; UK billionaires)

**Why Coordinated Timing Matters:**
- **2025-2026:** Window of political opportunity (Trump out, Labour in UK, NDP leverage in Canada)
- **Network Effects:** 1M Canadians switching banks is news; 10M North Americans is **crisis** for Big Banks
- **Policy Leverage:** If Canada + US + EU all pass wealth taxes, billionaires have nowhere to run

### Shared Toolkits

- **Translateable Resources:** Bank Switch Toolkit works in US (Chase/B of A), EU (Deutsche Bank)
- **Legal Templates:** BC's SVT → California Prop (ballot initiative); Burlington CLT → London CLT
- **Cross-Border Solidarity:** Canadian chapters support Amazon YYZ1 union; US chapters support Couche-Tard drives

**Precedent:** Fridays for Future (Greta Thunberg) coordinated 7M protesters globally via toolkit sharing.

## Not Welfare. Ownership.

This is not about handouts. It's about:
- **Equity** over extraction
- **Dividends** over dependence
- **Permanence** over charity

Workers and communities own the means of production, governance, and wealth. The 1% become irrelevant because they no longer control the levers.

The difference between **welfare** and **ownership**:
- Welfare: Government gives you $1,000/month → politicians cut it next year
- Ownership: You own shares in Wealth Fund → permanent $2,000/year dividend + appreciation

The difference between **charity** and **institutions**:
- Charity: Food bank helps 1,000 families this week → still 1,000 families next week
- Institutions: CLT builds 1,000 homes → affordable **forever**; next generation doesn't start from zero

**We're not asking billionaires to be nice. We're making them irrelevant.**

## Why We'll Win

**1. History Is On Our Side**

Every major redistribution happened via **organized pressure**:
- 1880s-1920s: Labour movement won 8-hour day, weekends, child labour bans
- 1930s-1940s: New Deal/post-war compression created middle class
- 1960s-1970s: Civil Rights, feminism, environmentalism won structural reforms

**Pattern:** Crisis → organized movement → policy wins → new normal.

We're in crisis (housing +350%, wages flat, debt $2.3T). The movement is building. Policy wins are next.

**2. Billionaires Are Fragile**

They control assets (stocks, real estate, media) but those require **our** cooperation:
- Banks need our deposits → move them, they collapse
- Workplaces need our labour → unionize, we control production
- Housing needs our rent → CLTs, we own land

**Their power is an illusion we maintain by obeying.** Stop obeying.

**3. We Outnumber Them 1,000,000:1**

- 61 billionaires vs. 40 million Canadians
- If 1% of us (400,000) organize, we have 6,500x their numbers
- If 10% organize (4 million), it's unstoppable

**Math matters:** Billionaires can't hire enough lawyers/PR firms/politicians to counter 4 million organized citizens.

**4. The Tactics Work (Proven)**

- **Bank boycotts:** #DeleteFacebook moved 10M users in 3 months
- **Union drives:** Starbucks unionized 400 stores in 3 years despite $10M union-busting
- **CLTs:** Burlington survived 40 years, zero foreclosures in 2008
- **Wealth funds:** Alaska Permanent Fund pays dividends for 42 years

**We're not inventing tactics. We're scaling proven ones.**

## Join the Reset

The 99% Reset isn't a protest. It's a construction project.

We're building:
- **Credit unions** to replace extractive banks
- **Worker co-ops** to replace exploitative corporations
- **Community Land Trusts** to replace speculative real estate
- **Citizens' Wealth Funds** to replace billionaire monopolies

Brick by brick, institution by institution, we're creating a parallel economy. Eventually, the old one becomes irrelevant.

**This takes a generation. We started in 2024. We'll finish by 2045.**

Your grandchildren will ask: "When billionaires ruled, what did you do?"

Your answer: "I switched my bank. I organized my workplace. I joined a chapter. I helped build the alternative."

**Ready to take action?**

- **Move your money:** [Switch to a credit union](/join#pledge)
- **Organize your workplace:** [Start a union drive](/join#union)
- **Build alternatives:** [Found a co-op or CLT](/join#founders)
- **Start a chapter:** [Organize locally](/chapters/apply)

**Not in 5 years. Today.**

The top 1% became irrelevant the moment you decided they were.
