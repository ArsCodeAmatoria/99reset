# The 99% Reset — The Plan

**Purpose:** Make the top 1% politically and economically irrelevant within a generation—non-violently—by shifting ownership and bargaining power to workers and communities.

---

## 1. Finance

<div id="finance"></div>

### The Problem
The financial system concentrates wealth upward. Banks, investment firms, and hedge funds serve the 1%, extracting value from workers and communities.

### The Solution
**Move deposits to credit unions** and seed a **Citizens' Wealth Fund** with:
- Phased transaction fees (0.01% starting, scaling to 0.1%)
- Provincial wealth taxes on assets over $10M
- Vacancy taxes on unused housing and commercial property

The fund generates dividends for all residents, creates permanent public wealth, and finances housing, co-ops, and infrastructure without debt.

### Key Metrics
- **$50B+** moved to credit unions by year 5
- **$2B** annual fund contributions by year 3
- **$500/year** per-capita dividend by year 10

---

## 2. Ownership

<div id="ownership"></div>

### The Problem
Ownership is concentrated. Workers create value but don't share in profits or governance. Housing is financialized, not homes.

### The Solution
**Scale worker co-ops and Community Land Trusts (CLTs):**

**Worker Co-ops:**
- One-member-one-vote governance
- Profit-sharing based on hours worked
- Sector-specific incubation programs (tech, manufacturing, care work)
- Wealth Fund financing for startup capital

**Community Land Trusts:**
- Permanent affordability (resale restrictions)
- Community governance of land
- Housing, commercial, and agricultural CLTs
- Prevents speculation and displacement

### Key Metrics
- **2,000 worker co-ops** by year 10
- **50,000 CLT homes** by year 10
- **30% profit-sharing** average in worker co-ops

---

## 3. Labour

<div id="labour"></div>

### The Problem
Labour's share of GDP has fallen for 40 years. Wages stagnate while executive pay and shareholder returns skyrocket. Workers have no voice.

### The Solution
**Unionize high-leverage employers** to restore labour's bargaining power:

**Target Sectors:**
- Tech (Amazon, Google, Apple)
- Logistics (FedEx, UPS, Amazon warehouses)
- Retail (Walmart, Target, grocery chains)
- Care work (nursing homes, child care, home care)

**Legal Changes:**
- Card-check certification (no employer intimidation)
- First-contract arbitration (break deadlocks)
- Sector-wide bargaining (lift all boats)
- Ban replacement workers during strikes

### Key Metrics
- **500+ successful union drives** by year 5
- **Labour's GDP share +5 points** by year 10
- **First-contract win rate 90%+**

---

## 4. Policy

<div id="policy"></div>

### Provincial & Federal Levers

**Taxation:**
- Wealth tax: 1% annually on net worth over $10M
- Land value tax: Replace property tax with tax on unimproved land value
- Vacancy tax: 3% annually on empty housing/commercial units

**Labour:**
- Card-check union certification
- First-contract arbitration
- Sectoral bargaining frameworks
- Ban strikebreakers

**Ownership:**
- Right of first refusal for worker buyouts
- Worker-ownership tax incentives
- CLT land acquisition funds
- Co-op incubation grants

**Wealth Fund Governance:**
- Transparent, democratic board
- Non-partisan, technocratic management
- Dividend formula tied to fund growth
- No politician discretion over payouts

## KPIs — How We Track Progress

## Not Welfare. Ownership.

This is not about handouts. It's about:
- **Equity** over extraction
- **Dividends** over dependence
- **Permanence** over charity

Workers and communities own the means of production, governance, and wealth. The 1% become irrelevant because they no longer control the levers.
