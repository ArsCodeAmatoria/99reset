## <JapaneseText>要約</JapaneseText> · Executive Summary

The **99% Reset** is a global, non-violent **democratic socialist movement** aimed at redistributing economic power from the top 1% to the broader population through targeted boycotts, tax activism, unionization, and **community ownership structures**—specifically **credit unions, Community Land Trusts (CLTs), worker co-ops, and Citizens&apos; Wealth Funds**. In Canada, where 61 billionaires control $324 billion in wealth amid record inequality (top 20% holding 64.7% of net worth), focusing efforts on high-impact individuals maximizes leverage for the Reset.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

This paper identifies **seven priority billionaires** based on criteria aligned with the Reset&apos;s phases: (1) **scale of wealth concentration** and its role in perpetuating debt-fueled consumption; (2) **direct contributions to systemic harms** like tax avoidance, fossil fuel financing, housing speculation, and luxury emissions; and (3) **vulnerability to coordinated action** (e.g., public exposure, divestment campaigns, unionization).

</Highlight>

Selection draws from Forbes 2025 data, CRA estimates, and reports from **Canadians for Tax Fairness (C4TF)** and Oxfam. By starving these &quot;parasites&quot; via **bank switches, co-op alternatives, and policy advocacy**, the Reset can unlock **$10-15 billion annually** in redirected revenue for **citizens&apos; funds and affordable housing**.

## <JapaneseText>序章</JapaneseText> · Introduction

</ColoredSection>

Canada&apos;s wealth inequality—exacerbated by billionaire-driven asset bubbles—predicts economic fragility, as evidenced by rising household debt ($18.2 trillion) and delinquencies. The **99% Reset** counters this not through confrontation but **mass withdrawal of consent**: boycotting enablers, closing loopholes, and building parallel systems rooted in **democratic ownership**.

Prioritizing billionaires requires precision. We target those whose fortunes amplify inequality (e.g., via **offshore havens** costing $3.65 billion yearly in lost taxes) and whose disruption yields cascading effects (e.g., crashing bank ratings or forcing real estate sales to **CLTs**). This is not about punishment—it&apos;s about structural rebalancing.

<Callout type="info">

**Criteria for focus:**
1. **Wealth scale:** Net worth >$5 billion; influence on GDP via assets
2. **Harm vectors:** Tax evasion, fossil fuel loans, housing speculation, luxury emissions
3. **Actionability:** Ties to boycotted banks, unionizable firms, or provincial tax levers

</Callout>

Data sources include Forbes&apos; 2025 Billionaires List (76 Canadians, total $359 billion), C4TF&apos;s 2025 tax haven report, and Oxfam&apos;s emissions analysis. Globally, this model extends to U.S. figures like Musk for cross-border campaigns.

## <JapaneseText>方法論</JapaneseText> · Methodology

</ColoredSection>

Billionaires were ranked from Forbes&apos; 2025 list (top 20 Canadians by net worth). **Scoring system (1-10 per criterion, total /40):**

- **Wealth concentration:** Net worth percentile relative to Canadian wealth distribution
- **Tax avoidance:** Subsidiaries in havens (Bermuda, Cayman; C4TF data)
- **Fossil/luxury financing:** Ties to Big 5 banks or emissions (Oxfam 2025)
- **Housing speculation:** Real estate holdings inflating costs (BC Assessment, CMHC)
- **Vulnerability:** Exposure to unions/co-ops (e.g., retail empires) or provincial taxes

**Threshold:** Top scorers (total >25/40) form the focus list. **Exclusions:** Crypto/tech like Zhao (low direct harm in Canada) or low-profile heirs without systemic ties.

## <JapaneseText>選択の根拠</JapaneseText> · Rationale for Selection

</ColoredSection>

These individuals aren&apos;t just wealthy—they actively perpetuate the systems the **99% Reset** seeks to dismantle. Here&apos;s why they&apos;re priority targets for our **democratic socialist movement**:

**Tax avoidance infrastructure:** Thomson, Bouchard, and Fidani&apos;s subsidiaries in tax havens cost Canada **$7B annually** (C4TF). The NDP&apos;s 2025 platform targets this via 66.7% capital gains inclusion—but we need these prosecutions to fund **credit unions and co-op development banks**.

**Housing speculation empire:** Gilgan, Wilson, Pattison, and Fidani control **15% of urban development**. Their vacant lands—taxable at 500% in BC models—could yield **60K CLT units**. Every acre they hoard is an acre denied to community ownership.

**Fossil and luxury emissions:** Big 5 bank ties (RBC/TD loans) fund jets and yachts emitting **17M tonnes CO2/year** (Oxfam). **Bank boycotts** targeting these loans crash their credit ratings 3x faster than regulatory pressure alone.

**Broader democratic impact:** Retail and pharma empires (Bouchard, Katz) are **unionizable** for 50K workers, raising wages 4-6% (OECD). Media monopolies (Thomson) counter propaganda—**media co-ops** like Ricochet and The Breach provide the alternative.

<Highlight>

**Non-selected billionaires:** Changpeng Zhao ($62.9B, crypto—low Canadian ties); Tobi Lütke ($8.9B, Shopify—tech innovation potential aligns with co-op conversion models).

## <JapaneseText>戦略的行動</JapaneseText> · Strategic Actions and Projected Impact

</ColoredSection>

Aligning with **Reset phases** and our democratic socialist core—**credit unions, CLTs, co-ops, and unions**:

### Phase 1: Starve the Parasite (2-4 Years)

**Tax activism:** Mass filings demanding CRA audits of Thomson&apos;s $240M avoidance. Join **C4TF petitions** (89% public support). **Projected: $2-3B immediate revenue** redirected to **credit union development** and **co-op financing**.

**Bank boycotts:** Shift $5T deposits from Big 5 (financing Katz and Wilson). Target Lululemon and Mattamy sales with coordinated consumer action (**-10% YoY** revenue impact). Every dollar moved to **Vancity or Desjardins** is a dollar starved from billionaire enablers.

**Union drives:** **5M workers** organized via Unifor at Couche-Tard and Mattamy construction sites. Card-check laws in BC and Québec accelerate this. Every unionized worker is a democratic socialist in training.

### Phase 2: Flood the Zone (4-8 Years)

**Progressive taxes:** Provincial wealth and land levies (BC model: **$30B/year**). Vacancy penalties force Fidani and Pattison sales to **CLTs**, permanently removing land from speculative markets.

**Ownership tsunami:** Colorado-style equity mandates for Gilgan builders—**2% annual sale to worker trusts**. **CWCF JEDDI funds** ($50K grants) seed 1K **co-ops** from retail divestments (Bouchard&apos;s Couche-Tard targeted for conversion).

**CLT expansion:** Acquire **10K affordable housing units** from speculative holdings (e.g., Wilson&apos;s Vancouver sites). Every CLT is **permanent affordability**—irreversible by future governments or market crashes.

### Phase 3: Make Wealth Worthless (8-20 Years)

**Citizens&apos; Wealth Fund:** 2-3% TSX transaction tax on Thomson and Pattison assets generates **$2-4K annual dividends per citizen**. Fund owns **40% market share** by 2040—making billionaires minority shareholders in their own empires.

**Helicopter reform:** Direct stimulus from recovered taxes (**$39B/year**) to bottom 80%, bypassing Cantillon effect. This is **post-scarcity** economics—abundance for all, not just the 1%.

Based on OECD, C4TF, and historical co-op models:

<Stats>
<Stat value="+4-6%" label="Wage Share Increase via Unions" icon="trending" />
<Stat value="60K Units" label="Affordable Housing via CLTs" icon="target" />
<Stat value="-20%" label="Luxury Emissions Reduction" icon="target" />
</Stats>

**Wealth redistribution:** Top 1% share drops from 25% to **18%** (mirroring post-WW2 Canada trajectory). **Wage share:** +4-6% via **unions** (**$50B annually** to workers, not shareholders). **Housing:** **60K affordable units** via **CLTs** (Burlington VT precedent scaled nationally). **Emissions:** -20% luxury CO2 via jet and yacht taxes (Oxfam model). **Economic democracy:** **40% market ownership** by Citizens&apos; Wealth Fund—**irreversible power** in worker and community hands.

## <JapaneseText>リスクと対策</JapaneseText> · Risks and Mitigations

</ColoredSection>

**Legal backlash and offshore flight:** Billionaires may flee to Dubai or Singapore. **Mitigation:** Global coordination via **#99ResetUS** for extradition pressure and reciprocal tax treaties. International democratic socialist solidarity is our shield.

**Media smear campaigns:** Thomson controls major outlets. **Counter:** Fund **Ricochet, The Breach, and other media co-ops** that can&apos;t be captured by billionaire interests. Truth is our weapon.

**Economic blowback fears:** Opponents will claim job losses in targeted firms. **Offset:** **Co-op transitions** (Québec model: **10K new co-ops by 2035**) create *more* jobs with *higher* wages and *democratic* control. We&apos;re not destroying jobs—we&apos;re democratizing them.

## <JapaneseText>結論</JapaneseText> · Conclusion

</ColoredSection>

Focusing on these **seven billionaires** operationalizes the **99% Reset** in Canada, transforming $324B in concentrated wealth into **democratic assets**—**credit unions, CLTs, co-ops, and wealth funds** owned by the people. This is not punishment but **structural rebalancing**: their fortunes, built on public infrastructure and dodged taxes, will fund the very systems (unions, CLTs, funds) that render them irrelevant.

<Highlight>

Historical precedents—**Sweden&apos;s 1950s reforms, Québec co-ops, Mondragón&apos;s 80K worker-owners**—show success without violence. This is the **democratic socialist** path: patient, strategic, and irreversible.

</Highlight>

Globally, extend this model to Musk, Bezos, and other oligarchs for cross-border synergy. The movement begins with your **30-day action**: switch banks to **credit unions**, sign **C4TF petitions**, organize your workplace into a **union**, join a **CLT**, start a **co-op**. 

**In one generation, Forbes&apos; billionaire list becomes a relic of history.**
