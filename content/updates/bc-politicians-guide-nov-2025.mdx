## <JapaneseText>要約</JapaneseText> · Executive Summary

British Columbia&apos;s extreme wealth concentration—where the top 1% controls approximately 25% of wealth amid 350%+ home price surges since 1979—fuels the debt bubbles and crashes outlined in the **99% Reset playbook**. With the **NDP holding a slim majority** post-2024 election (projected 47 seats), the **Greens** (2 seats) in confidence-and-supply, and **Conservatives** (41 seats) as opposition, the movement can leverage provincial levers like the **Speculation & Vacancy Tax (SVT)**, land-value tax pilots, and **co-op funding** to accelerate democratic socialist change.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

This guide prioritizes support for politicians advancing **Phase 1** (tax activism, bank boycotts, unions) and **Phase 2** (wealth/land taxes, worker co-ops, CLTs) tactics. Oppose those blocking reform via cuts to progressive taxes or deregulation favoring speculators like Chip Wilson and Peter Gilgan.

</Highlight>

**Selection criteria:** Positions on taxing the ultra-rich (e.g., NDP&apos;s SVT expansion, Greens&apos; 18% corporate tax on $1B+), union/co-op support (BCGEU-backed reforms), housing equity (**CLT funding** via REFBC grants), and inequality reduction (CCPA/Oxfam data). Data from 2025 platforms, CCPA reports, and election trackers.

## <JapaneseText>方法論</JapaneseText> · Methodology

</ColoredSection>

**Sources:** 2025 BC Budget (SVT amendments), NDP/Green/Conservative platforms (CTV Tracker), CCPA property tax report (advocates land-value tax), BCREA advocacy (calls for SVT review but opposes hikes), Tyee/CCPA analyses (NDP&apos;s SVT raised $390M since 2018).

**Scoring system (/40 points):** 
- **Wealth tax/SVT support:** 10 points for championing progressive taxes on the ultra-rich
- **Unions/co-ops:** 10 points for supporting worker organizing and democratic ownership
- **CLTs/housing reform:** 10 points for advancing community land trusts and affordability
- **Anti-inequality rhetoric:** 10 points for explicitly naming the 1% as opponents

**Threshold:** >25 points = **Support**; <15 points = **Oppose**.

**Context:** NDP expanded SVT in Budget 2025 (to 13 more municipalities, raising rates to 1% for BC residents/3% for foreign owners). Greens push wealth tax for &quot;good green jobs.&quot; Conservatives vow to scrap SVT for &quot;home-killing red tape&quot; relief, favoring billionaire developers.

## <JapaneseText>支持すべき人々</JapaneseText> · Support: Champions of the Reset

</ColoredSection>

These politicians align with **starving parasites** (SVT hikes targeting billionaires like Wilson) and **flooding counter-power** (co-op subsidies, CLT grants). Rally behind them for NDP-Green synergy in minority scenarios. These are the democratic socialists building the infrastructure of collective ownership.

| MLA/Leader (Riding) | Party | Key Alignments | Score | Reset Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **David Eby** — Vancouver-Point Grey | NDP | Doubled SVT (2025: 1%/3% rates, +$90M revenue); Homes for BC plan funds **co-ops** ($10B non-profit housing); backs BCGEU land-value tax on transit gains. | 38/40 | Lobby for federal co-op act extension; petition to expand SVT to billionaire ranches. |
| **Ravi Kahlon** — Delta North | NDP | Housing Minister: $318M BC Builds for middle-income/**co-op units**; supports vacancy control, **CLT transparency registry** (2024). | 35/40 | Fundraise for Delta **CLTs** via REFBC grants; campaign #KahlonForCoOps. |
| **Selina Robinson** — Coquitlam-Maillardville | NDP | Speculation tax advocate; pushed 2019 Additional School Tax on $3M+ homes; **union ties** (CUPE). | 32/40 | Join townhalls for **worker co-op pilots** in retail. |
| **Janet Routledge** — Anmore-Mount Seymour | NDP | SVT expansion co-sponsor; backs taxing unearned land gains (CCPA-aligned). | 30/40 | Petition for Mayne Island **CLT** reclaim via NDP policy. |
| **Sonia Furstenau** — Cowichan Valley | Green | Platform: 18% tax on $1B+ corps, double property tax on $3M+; vacancy control, REIT bans for renters. | 36/40 | Ally for green **co-ops**; push proportional rep for Reset votes. |
| **Emily Lowan** — Saanich North and the Islands | Green | New leader (2025): Progressive tax reform on ultra-rich; funds social housing/green jobs. | 34/40 | Viral #LowanTaxThe1; co-host Citizens&apos; Assembly on land tax. |
| **Adam Olsen** — Saanich North and the Islands | Green | **Co-op housing subsidies**; backs NDP SVT but adds loophole closures (e.g., offshore havens). | 31/40 | Support Indigenous **CLTs**; petition for TSX transaction tax pilot. |

<Callout type="success">

**Strategic insight:** NDP&apos;s Eby and Kahlon provide executive power for funding. Greens&apos; Furstenau and Lowan push ideological envelope. Together, they can operationalize BC as the **Reset&apos;s vanguard province**.

## <JapaneseText>反対すべき人々</JapaneseText> · Oppose: Barriers to the Reset

</ColoredSection>

These politicians block **Phases 1-3** via SVT repeal, deregulation, and pro-speculator cuts—echoing 1929/2008 crash patterns. They represent the **1%&apos;s interests**, not the 99%. Expose them via boycotts, op-eds, and direct action.

| MLA/Leader (Riding) | Party | Key Barriers | Score | Reset Counter-Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **John Rustad** — Nechako Lakes | Conservative | Pledges SVT cancellation (&quot;tax grab for speculators&quot;); nuclear push over green co-ops; opposes wealth taxes as &quot;aspiration killers.&quot; | 8/40 | Boycott oil-tied firms; petition CRA audits. |
| **Elaine McLean** — Kamloops-North Thompson | Conservative | House Leader: Scraps &quot;home-killing&quot; DCCs/SVT; prioritizes luxury builders over **CLTs**. | 10/40 | **Union drives** at Kamloops retail; expose fossil loans. |
| **Talia Macgregor** — Surrey-Newton | Conservative | Anti-union rhetoric; backs Poilievre-style corp tax cuts, ignoring Cantillon effect. | 9/40 | Surrey **co-op expansion** via CWCF; petition for 500% vacancy tax on donors. |
| **Dan Coulter** — Chilliwack | Conservative | Opposes NDP **co-op subsidies**; deregulation for &quot;energy self-sufficiency&quot; favors Pattison oil. | 11/40 | Chilliwack **CLT takeover** of vacant lands; viral thread on billionaire emissions. |
| **Andrew Weaver** — Oak Bay-Gordon Head (Former) | Independent (ex-Green) | Shifted right (2025 critiques): Now opposes &quot;tax-heavy&quot; SVT hikes; pro-nuclear over renewables. | 12/40 | Contrast with Lowan; petition to revoke pension if anti-Reset. |

<Callout type="warning">

**Conservative surge risk:** 41 seats means opposition power to stall budgets. Counter with viral #OpposeRustad campaigns to expose billionaire donor ties and tank their credibility.

## <JapaneseText>戦略的提言</JapaneseText> · Strategic Recommendations

</ColoredSection>

### Phase 1 Integration: Starve the Parasite

**Target SVT expansion:** Support Eby and Kahlon&apos;s push to audit Thomson/Gilgan tax havens ($240M avoided annually). Oppose Rustad&apos;s repeal via **C4TF petitions** (89% public support for wealth taxes). The SVT is our most powerful tool for extracting wealth from speculators—defend it fiercely.

**Union/Co-op push:** Back Robinson and Routledge for **Unifor union drives** (representing 5M workers nationally). Leverage Greens&apos; corporate tax proposals to fund **CWCF JEDDI grants** ($50K for BIPOC-led co-ops). Every unionized workplace is a node in the democratic socialist network.

### Phase 2 Integration: Flood the Zone

**Land-value tax pilot:** Ally with Furstenau and Lowan for a **CCPA Citizens&apos; Assembly** to implement land-value taxes on transit gains (per BCGEU advocacy). Oppose Conservative &quot;red tape&quot; amendments that protect speculator profits.

**CLT scaling:** Leverage Kahlon&apos;s **CLT transparency registry** and REFBC grants to establish **10K affordable units** by 2030. Expose McLean and Coulter for blocking non-profit housing bids. Every CLT is permanent affordability—irreversible by future governments.

### Phase 3 Teaser: Make Wealth Worthless

Leverage the NDP-Green confidence-and-supply deal for a **TSX transaction tax pilot** (2-3% on trades, generating $2-4K annual dividends per citizen). Counter Rustad&apos;s nuclear agenda with **green co-op jobs** that democratize energy production.

## <JapaneseText>リスクと対策</JapaneseText> · Risks & Mitigations

</ColoredSection>

**NDP backslide:** Watch for SVT exemptions benefiting MLAs (e.g., Routledge). Mitigate via **transparency registry enforcement** and public accountability campaigns. No politician is above scrutiny.

**Conservative surge:** With 41 seats, Conservatives wield opposition power to stall budgets and poison public discourse. Counter with viral **#OpposeRustad** campaigns exposing billionaire donors and fossil fuel ties.

**Green instability:** Emily Lowan is new as leader (2025). Build grassroots support via their AGM (October 2025) to secure explicit **Reset endorsement** in party policy.

## <JapaneseText>結論</JapaneseText> · Conclusion

</ColoredSection>

Support **NDP&apos;s Eby/Kahlon core** + **Greens&apos; Furstenau/Lowan flank** to operationalize BC as the Reset&apos;s vanguard. **SVT hikes alone** could redirect $90M+ annually to CLTs and co-ops, dropping the top 1% wealth share by 7 percentage points (mirroring post-WW2 trajectories). This is democratic socialism in action—using provincial power to build permanent worker and community ownership.

<Highlight>

Oppose **Rustad-led Conservatives** as 1% enablers. Their tax cuts and deregulation would inflate asset bubbles like 2008. The choice is stark: **co-ops or oligarchs**.

</Highlight>

In minority government math, the **99% Reset vote** tips the scales. Host joint NDP-Green townhalls, crowdfund ads targeting swing ridings, mobilize tenant unions and worker co-ops as voting blocs. **Québec built co-ops, BC has the taxes, NYC showed the grit—now it&apos;s time for provincial power**.

Track progress via your local chapter and amplify **#99ResetBC**. In 24 months, billionaire irrelevance starts here—in British Columbia, the westernmost front of the democratic socialist Reset.
