## Executive Summary

British Columbia's extreme wealth concentration—top 1% controlling approximately 25% of wealth amid 350%+ home price surges since 1979—fuels the debt bubbles and crashes outlined in the 99% Reset playbook. With the NDP holding a slim majority post-2024 election (projected 47 seats), the Greens (2 seats) in confidence-and-supply, and Conservatives (41 seats) as opposition, your movement can leverage provincial levers like the Speculation & Vacancy Tax (SVT, raised to 1% for locals/3% foreign in 2025), land-value tax pilots, and co-op funding.

This guide prioritizes support for politicians advancing **Phase 1** (tax activism, bank boycotts, unions) and **Phase 2** (wealth/land taxes, worker co-ops, CLTs) tactics. Oppose those blocking via cuts to progressive taxes or deregulation favoring speculators (e.g., Chip Wilson, Peter Gilgan).

**Selection criteria:** Positions on taxing the ultra-rich (e.g., NDP's SVT expansion, Greens' 18% corporate tax on $1B+), union/co-op support (BCGEU-backed reforms), housing equity (CLT funding via REFBC grants), and inequality reduction (CCPA/Oxfam data). Data from 2025 platforms, CCPA reports, and election trackers.

**Focus:** 10 key MLAs/leaders (5 support, 5 oppose).

**Actions:** Endorse via #99ResetBC petitions, lobby for Citizens' Assembly on land tax, and viral campaigns.

## Methodology

**Sources:** 2025 BC Budget (SVT amendments), NDP/Green/Conservative platforms (CTV Tracker), CCPA property tax report (advocates land-value tax), BCREA advocacy (calls for SVT review but opposes hikes), Tyee/CCPA analyses (NDP's SVT raised $390M since 2018).

**Scoring (/40):** 
- Wealth tax/SVT support (10 points)
- Unions/co-ops (10 points)
- CLTs/housing reform (10 points)
- Anti-inequality rhetoric (10 points)

**Threshold:** &gt;25 = Support; &lt;15 = Oppose.

**Context:** NDP expanded SVT in Budget 2025 (to 13 more municipalities); Greens push wealth tax for "good green jobs"; Conservatives vow to scrap SVT for "home-killing red tape" relief.

## Support: Champions of the Reset

These politicians align with starving parasites (SVT hikes targeting billionaires like Wilson) and flooding counter-power (co-op subsidies, CLT grants). Rally behind them for NDP-Green synergy in minority scenarios.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Oppose: Barriers to the Reset

These block Phase 1-3 via SVT repeal, deregulation, and pro-speculator cuts—echoing 1929/2008 patterns. Expose via boycotts and op-eds.


| MLA/Leader (Riding) | Party | Key Barriers | Score | Reset Counter-Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **John Rustad** — Nechako Lakes | Conservative | Pledges SVT cancellation ("tax grab for speculators"); nuclear push over green co-ops; opposes wealth taxes as "aspiration killers." | 8/40 | Boycott oil-tied firms; petition CRA audits. |
| **Elaine McLean** — Kamloops-North Thompson | Conservative | House Leader: Scraps "home-killing" DCCs/SVT; prioritizes luxury builders over CLTs. | 10/40 | Union drives at Kamloops retail; expose fossil loans. |
| **Talia Macgregor** — Surrey-Newton | Conservative | Anti-union rhetoric; backs Poilievre-style corp tax cuts, ignoring Cantillon effect. | 9/40 | Surrey co-op expansion via CWCF; petition for 500% vacancy tax on donors. |
| **Dan Coulter** — Chilliwack | Conservative | Opposes NDP co-op subsidies; deregulation for "energy self-sufficiency" favors Pattison oil. | 11/40 | Chilliwack CLT takeover of vacant lands; viral thread on billionaire emissions. |
| **Andrew Weaver** — Oak Bay-Gordon Head (Former) | Independent (ex-Green) | Shifted right (2025 critiques): Now opposes "tax-heavy" SVT hikes; pro-nuclear over renewables. | 12/40 | Contrast with Lowan; petition to revoke pension if anti-Reset. |

## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1 Integration (Starve the Parasite)

**Target SVT Expansion:** Support Eby/Kahlon to audit Thomson/Gilgan havens ($240M avoided); oppose Rustad's repeal via C4TF petitions (89% support).

**Union/Co-op Push:** Back Robinson/Routledge for Unifor drives (5M workers); Greens' corporate tax funds CWCF JEDDI ($50K grants).

### Phase 2 Integration (Flood the Zone)

**Land-Value Tax Pilot:** Ally with Furstenau/Lowan for CCPA Citizens' Assembly (tax transit gains, per BCGEU); oppose Conservative "red tape" amendments.

**CLT Scaling:** Kahlon's registry + REFBC grants for 10K units; expose McLean/Coulter for blocking non-profit bids.

### Phase 3 Tease (Make Wealth Worthless)

Leverage NDP-Green deal for TSX tax (2-3%, $2-4K dividends); counter Rustad's nuclear with green co-op jobs.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**NDP Backslide:** SVT exemptions for MLAs (e.g., Routledge); mitigate via transparency registry enforcement.

**Conservative Surge:** 41 seats = opposition power; viral #OpposeRustad to tank billionaire donors.

**Green Instability:** Lowan new (2025); build via AGM (Oct 2025) for Reset endorsement.

---

## Conclusion

Support NDP's Eby/Kahlon core + Greens' Furstenau/Lowan flank to operationalize BC as Reset vanguard—SVT hikes alone could redirect $90M+ to CLTs/co-ops, dropping top 1% share 7 points (post-WW2 trajectory). 

Oppose Rustad-led Conservatives as 1% enablers, whose cuts would inflate bubbles like 2008. 

In minority math, your 99% Reset votes tip scales: Host joint townhalls, crowdfund ads. Québec co-ops, BC taxes, NYC grit—now provincial power. 

Track via your local chapter; amplify **#99ResetBC**. In 24 months, billionaire irrelevance starts here.
