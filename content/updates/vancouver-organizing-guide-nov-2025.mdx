## <JapaneseText>要約</JapaneseText> · Executive Summary

Vancouver exemplifies Canada&apos;s wealth crisis in microcosm: average home prices exceed **$1.2 million** (up 350% since 1979), rents have surged 20% YoY, and the top 1% controls ~25% of wealth while 40% of residents hold just 3.3% net worth. Billionaires like **Chip Wilson** ($7.5B, Lululemon real estate empire) and **Jim Pattison** ($11.4B, diversified holdings) amplify speculation, with BlackRock/Vanguard owning 22% of rentals.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

The **99% Reset** counters this through non-violent **democratic socialist tactics**: bank boycotts of Big Five institutions (financing $900B in fossil fuels), **union drives** (targeting low-wage retail), **worker co-ops, Community Land Trusts (CLTs)**, and provincial **wealth taxes**—the four pillars of economic democracy.

</Highlight>

This guide adapts the global playbook for Vancouver&apos;s unique context—leveraging the **NDP&apos;s Speculation & Vacancy Tax (SVT, $90M revenue in 2025)**, **COPE&apos;s tenant union push**, and the **Green Party&apos;s 18% corporate tax proposal**. Key allies include **Union Cooperative Initiative (UCI), Vancouver & District Labour Council (VDLC, 60K members), Metro Vancouver Alliance (MVA)**, and **CHF BC&apos;s CLT network** (10th anniversary 2025).

## <JapaneseText>背景</JapaneseText> · Introduction

</ColoredSection>

Vancouver&apos;s inequality—**Gini coefficient at 49 points** (highest ever recorded)—fuels debt ($18.2T household total nationally) and economic instability, as wages stagnate (-2.1% YoY real). The **99% Reset** makes the 1% irrelevant via **ownership, not charity**: **Co-ops** for workers, **CLTs** for housing, **credit unions** for finance, and **taxes** for wealth funds. This is **democratic socialism**—patient, strategic, and permanent.

Locally, **NDP Premier David Eby&apos;s SVT expansion** (1% for BC residents, 3% for foreign owners) and Vancouver&apos;s fast-track social housing rezoning (2024) provide legislative levers. **COPE&apos;s "Fight for Housing" platform** (tenant unions, empty home tax hikes) and **Greens&apos; wealth tax proposals** align perfectly with Reset goals.

<Callout type="info">

This paper outlines **three phases** tailored to Vancouver: **Phase 1** (boycotts/unions via VDLC), **Phase 2** (CLTs/co-ops with CHF BC/UCI), **Phase 3** (TSX tax pilots for wealth funds). Data from StatsCan Q1 2025, C4TF, and CNCLT (40+ CLTs nationwide, 24% growth 2024).

</Callout>

**Risks:** Developer backlash (e.g., Wilson&apos;s anti-union history). **Mitigation:** MVA coalitions uniting faith communities, labor, and housing justice activists.

## <JapaneseText>地域の機会</JapaneseText> · Local Context and Opportunities

</ColoredSection>

Vancouver&apos;s organizing ecosystem is ripe for **democratic socialist** transformation. Private-sector **union density** sits at just 15% (vs. 72% public), but **VDLC** affiliates represent 90+ unions and 60K workers. Our **co-op history** includes **VALU CO-OP** (Chinatown print shop, transferred to UCI 2025). On housing, **CHF BC&apos;s CLT** has saved/developed 48+ units (e.g., 1700 Kingsway).

Politically, the **NDP&apos;s slim majority** (47 seats) needs **Green support** (2 seats) in a confidence-and-supply arrangement. **COPE and Vision Vancouver** push municipal reforms. Our **billionaire targets**: Wilson (BC speculation tax exposure), Pattison (Vancouver estates driving land values).

**Upcoming events:** BC Greens AGM Nov 14-16 (social Nov 14, Coast Coal Harbour); CNCLT Members Meeting Nov 4 (virtual, but local tie-in); Eastside Culture Crawl Nov 2025 (500+ artists for **co-op** networking).

| Opportunity | Description | Reset Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SVT Expansion** | NDP 2025: +13 municipalities, **$90M revenue** for co-ops. | **Phase 1:** Tax loopholes (Wilson holdings). |
| **Tenant Unions** | COPE bylaw: Legalize bargaining, end demovictions. | **Phase 2:** Counter demovictions via **CLTs**. |
| **Co-op Funding** | City fast-track: Rezoning cuts costs 20-30% for non-profits. | **Phase 2:** UCI BUILD program for 10 co-ops. |
| **Union Drives** | CUPE: 3,200+ UBC GRAs unionized 2025. | **Phase 1:** VDLC targets Lululemon/Amazon. |

<Highlight>

Vancouver can become the **vanguard city** of the Canadian democratic socialist movement—combining provincial tax power, municipal fast-tracking, and grassroots organizing infrastructure.

## <JapaneseText>フェーズ１</JapaneseText> · Phase 1: Starve the Parasite (2-4 Years)

</ColoredSection>

Focus on **boycotting Big Five banks** (RBC/TD finance Wilson&apos;s jets), **unionizing 5K workers**, and **tax activism** on havens ($682B hidden offshore nationally).

### Bank Boycott: Starving Billionaire Enablers

Switch to **Vancity** (ethical, +3.26% Q1 2025 growth). **Target: $500M outflow** (0.33% of Big Five deposits regionally). Launch at **Nov 14 Green social**—VDLC rally **Nov 22** (post-AGM). Every dollar moved to **Vancity** is a dollar starved from billionaire-enabling banks that fund fossil fuels ($900B since 2016) and luxury real estate speculation.

**Mechanism:** Vancity is a **credit union**—member-owned, democratically governed (one member, one vote), and ethically invested. By redirecting deposits, we build **parallel financial power** while destabilizing institutions that enable the 1%.

### Union Drives: Building Worker Power

**VDLC and CUPE** target **Lululemon** (Wilson, notoriously anti-union), **Science World** (CUPE 2025 win), and **Amazon** warehouses. Every 10% density increase = **+4-6% wages** (OECD data). Start at **Nov 8 VDLC affiliate event**. Organize card-check campaigns in BC (easier than U.S. NLRB elections).

**Why unions matter:** They&apos;re the gateway to **co-ops**. Unionized workers understand collective action and democratic governance—making them ideal candidates for **worker co-op conversions** in Phase 2.

### Tax Activism: Exposing Billionaire Havens

Petition **Premier Eby** for SVT expansion to billionaire ranches (Pattison holdings). Join **C4TF (Canadians for Tax Fairness)** campaigns (89% public support for wealth taxes). **MVA** listening campaigns on housing/poverty build coalitions across faith communities, unions, and tenant organizations.

<Callout type="info">

**Milestone:** 1K bank switchers by Dec 2025; **$50M outflow** triggers OSFI review (per our cascade model). **5K new union members** by mid-2027 laying groundwork for co-op conversions.

</Callout>

<ColoredSection color="accent">

## <JapaneseText>フェーズ２</JapaneseText> · Phase 2: Flood the Zone with Counter-Power (4-8 Years)

</ColoredSection>

Build **democratic socialist alternatives**: **co-ops, CLTs, and media**—using the City&apos;s social housing initiative (25 Villages for multiplexes/co-ops).

### Worker Co-op Explosion: Democratizing the Economy

**UCI&apos;s BUILD program** (planning/startup support) and the **VALU model** for arts (Chinatown studio, 100s of artists). **CWCF JEDDI** funds BIPOC-led conversions ($50K grants). **Goal: 10 co-ops by 2030**—including gig workers via **Unifor** campaigns.

**Target sectors:** Retail (small chains ripe for employee buyouts), tech (developer co-ops for ethical software), food service (restaurant co-ops avoiding exploitation), and creative industries (artist co-ops like VALU).

### CLT Takeover: Permanent Affordability

**CHF BC tour** (Apr 2025 model): Acquire vacant lots (e.g., East Pender, Aaron Webster site). Advocate for **500% tax on investor homes** (BlackRock owns 22% of rentals). **CNCLT Summit 2025** planning—local chapter following Parkdale/Hogan&apos;s Alley models. **Target: 1K units** by 2030, including **decolonization via Indigenous CLTs**.

<Highlight>

**CLTs are irreversible.** Once land is in trust with 99-year leases, no developer can buy it, no politician can sell it, no market crash can inflate it. This is **permanent affordability** through **democratic ownership**.

</Highlight>

### Media Co-ops & Tenant Unions

Cancel Rogers (billionaire-owned mainstream media); fund **Ricochet and The Breach** (worker-owned journalism). **COPE bylaw:** Legalize tenant unions (SF model—bargain rents, open landlord books). **MVA:** Faith/union pledges for vacancy control.

**Integration:** Attend **Nov 19 NDP resolution workshop** (virtual)—pitch co-op subsidies and CLT funding tied to SVT revenue.

## <JapaneseText>フェーズ３</JapaneseText> · Phase 3: Make Their Wealth Worthless (8-20 Years)

</ColoredSection>

### Citizens' Wealth Fund Pilot

**2-3% TSX transaction tax** (Greens platform) generates **$2-4K annual dividends per citizen**. NDP Victory Bonds redirect fossil subsidies ($18B nationally) into democratic investment vehicles. This is **post-scarcity** economics—abundance distributed to all, not hoarded by the 1%.

### Helicopter Money: Direct Stimulus

Direct stimulus to bottom 80% via recovered **SVT revenue** ($390M raised since 2018 in BC). End the **Cantillon effect** (where QE money flows to elites first): **First $10K/month** goes to citizens, not banks or corporations. This is democratic socialism&apos;s answer to trickle-down economics—**trickle-up** prosperity.

### Land Reform

City **right-of-first-refusal** on apartments → public/co-op housing (COPE proposal). Leverage 25 Villages initiative for **60K affordable units** citywide. Every speculator sale becomes a **CLT acquisition**.

</ColoredSection>

| Model | Impact | Vancouver Tie-In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Québec Co-ops (1930s)** | Highest density globally; Gini drop from 42% to 18% (1950-1980). | **UCI/VALU:** Arts union co-op (2025 transfer). |
| **BC SVT (2018+)** | **$390M revenue**; vacancy -20%. | Expand to Pattison estates. |
| **CHF CLT (2015-2025)** | 48+ units saved/developed. | Olympic Village/Railyard co-op models. |
| **MVA (2010s)** | 100+ orgs; housing/transit wins. | 2025 listening on poverty/isolation. |

<Callout type="success">

Post-WW2 BC saw the top 1% wealth share fall from **42% to 18%** via unions and progressive taxes. We&apos;re replicating this via **VDLC organizing** and **NDP tax policy**—but with permanent institutions (CLTs, co-ops) that can&apos;t be reversed.

## <JapaneseText>リスクと対策</JapaneseText> · Risks and Mitigations

</ColoredSection>

**Developer backlash:** Wilson and other billionaires will mobilize lobbying against SVT expansion and CLT funding. **Counter:** **MVA rallies** uniting 100+ organizations, faith communities providing moral authority, and viral campaigns exposing billionaire tax avoidance.

**Low turnout:** Vancouver&apos;s rainy November weather can dampen participation. **Mitigation:** Hybrid events via **Zoom** (CNCLT Nov 4 virtual model), coffee shop organizing meetings, and leveraging existing networks (union locals, faith groups).

**NDP wobble:** Watch for SVT exemptions benefiting politicians or donors. **Accountability:** Transparency via **CityHallWatch**, public pressure campaigns, and municipal election organizing (2026).

## <JapaneseText>結論</JapaneseText> · Conclusion

</ColoredSection>

Vancouver—ground zero for Canadian housing speculation and billionaire wealth hoarding—can lead the **99% Reset** as the vanguard city of **democratic socialism**. **UCI co-ops** starve parasites, **CHF CLTs** flood counter-power, and **SVT revenue** ($90M annually) funds the Reset infrastructure. With NDP/Greens/COPE political synergy and November organizing events, we can scale this model nationally.

<Highlight>

**The 1% (Wilson/Pattison) rule on our consent—withdraw it.** In 24 months: 10K unionized, 1K housed in **CLTs**, $500M in **credit unions**. Québec built the co-op model. BC has the taxes. Vancouver will prove **democratic ownership works**.

</Highlight>

This is not protest—it&apos;s **construction**. We&apos;re building the **credit unions, CLTs, co-ops, and unions** that will outlast any billionaire, any politician, any economic crash. **Copy. Organize. Own.**

**#99ResetVan — The future is collectively owned.**
