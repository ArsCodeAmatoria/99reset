## Executive Summary

Vancouver exemplifies Canada's wealth crisis: Average home prices exceed $1.2 million (up 350% since 1979), rents have surged 20% YoY, and the top 1% controls ~25% of wealth while 40% of residents hold just 3.3% net worth. Billionaires like Chip Wilson ($7.5B, Lululemon real estate empire) and Jim Pattison ($11.4B, diversified holdings) amplify speculation, with BlackRock/Vanguard owning 22% of rentals. The 99% Reset counters this through non-violent tactics: Bank boycotts of Big Five institutions (financing $900B fossil fuels), union drives (targeting low-wage retail), worker co-ops, Community Land Trusts (CLTs), and provincial wealth taxes.

This guide adapts the global playbook for Vancouver's context—leveraging NDP's Speculation & Vacancy Tax (SVT, $90M revenue in 2025), COPE's tenant union push, and Green Party's 18% corporate tax proposal. Key allies: Union Cooperative Initiative (UCI), Vancouver & District Labour Council (VDLC, 60K members), Metro Vancouver Alliance (MVA), and CHF BC's CLT network (10th anniversary 2025). Projected: 10K new union members, $500M redirected deposits to Vancity, and 1K CLT units in 24 months. Start with a November 14 Green Party social—scale via #99ResetVan.

## Introduction

Vancouver's inequality—Gini coefficient at 49 points (highest ever)—fuels debt ($18.2T household total) and crashes, as wages stagnate (-2.1% YoY). The 99% Reset makes the 1% irrelevant via ownership: Co-ops for workers, CLTs for housing, taxes for funds. Locally, NDP Premier David Eby's SVT expansion (1% locals/3% foreign) and Vancouver's fast-track social housing rezoning (2024) provide levers. COPE's "Fight for Housing" platform (tenant unions, empty home tax hikes) and Greens' wealth tax align perfectly.

This paper outlines phases tailored to Vancouver: Phase 1 (boycotts/unions via VDLC), Phase 2 (CLTs/co-ops with CHF BC/UCI), Phase 3 (TSX tax pilots). Data from StatsCan Q1 2025, C4TF, and CNCLT (40+ CLTs nationwide, 24% growth 2024). Risks: Developer backlash (e.g., Wilson's anti-union history); mitigate via MVA coalitions.

## Local Context and Opportunities

Vancouver's ecosystem is ripe: 15% private-sector union density (vs. 72% public), but VDLC affiliates 90+ unions (60K workers). Co-op history: VALU CO-OP (Chinatown print shop, transferred to UCI 2025). Housing: CHF BC's CLT saved/developed 48+ units (e.g., 1700 Kingsway). Political: NDP's slim majority (47 seats) needs Green support (2 seats); COPE/Vision Vancouver push municipal reforms.

Billionaire targets: Wilson (BC speculation tax exposure), Pattison (Vancouver estates). Events: BC Greens AGM Nov 14-16 (social Nov 14, Coast Coal Harbour); CNCLT Members Meeting Nov 4 (virtual, but local tie-in); Eastside Culture Crawl Nov 2025 (500+ artists for co-op networking).

| Opportunity | Description | Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SVT Expansion | NDP 2025: +13 municipalities, $90M revenue for co-ops. | Phase 1: Tax loopholes (Wilson holdings). |
| Tenant Unions | COPE bylaw: Legalize bargaining, end demovictions. | Phase 2: Counter demovictions via CLTs. |
| Co-op Funding | City fast-track: Rezoning cuts costs 20-30% for non-profits. | Phase 2: UCI BUILD program for 10 co-ops. |
| Union Drives | CUPE: 3,200+ UBC GRAs unionized 2025. | Phase 1: VDLC targets Lululemon/Amazon. |

## Phase 1: Starve the Parasite (2-4 Years) – Vancouver Edition

Focus: Boycott Big Five (RBC/TD finance Wilson's jets), unionize 5K workers, tax activism on havens ($682B hidden).

**Bank Boycott:** Switch to Vancity (ethical, +3.26% Q1 2025 growth). Target: $500M outflow (0.33% Big Five deposits). Launch at Nov 14 Green social—VDLC rally Nov 22 (post-AGM).

**Union Drives:** VDLC/CUPE: Target Lululemon (Wilson, anti-union), Science World (CUPE 2025 win), Amazon. Every 10% density = +4-6% wages (OECD). Start: Nov 8 VDLC affiliate event.

**Tax Activism:** Petition Eby for SVT on billionaire ranches (Pattison); join C4TF (89% support). MVA listening campaigns (housing/poverty focus) build coalitions.

**Milestone:** 1K switchers by Dec 2025; $50M outflow triggers OSFI review (per cascade paper).

## Phase 2: Flood the Zone with Counter-Power (4-8 Years)

Build alternatives: Co-ops, CLTs, media—using City's social housing initiative (25 Villages for multiplexes/co-ops).

**Worker Co-op Explosion:** UCI's BUILD program (planning/startup support); VALU model for arts (Chinatown studio, 100s artists). CWCF JEDDI funds BIPOC conversions. Goal: 10 co-ops by 2030 (e.g., gig workers via Unifor).

**CLTs Takeover:** CHF BC tour (Apr 2025 model): Acquire vacant lots (e.g., East Pender, Aaron Webster site). Tax 500% on investor homes (BlackRock 22% rentals). CNCLT Summit 2025 planning—local chapter via Parkdale/Hogan's Alley models. Target: 1K units, decolonize via Indigenous CLTs.

**Media Co-ops & Tenant Unions:** Cancel Rogers (billionaire-owned); fund Ricochet/The Breach. COPE bylaw: Legalize unions (SF model—bargain rents, open landlord books). MVA: Faith/union pledges for vacancy control.

**Integration:** Nov 19 NDP resolution workshop (virtual)—pitch co-op subsidies.

## Phase 3: Make Their Wealth Worthless (8-20 Years)

**Citizens' Wealth Fund Pilot:** 2-3% TSX tax (Greens platform) → $2-4K dividends. NDP Victory Bonds redirect fossil subsidies ($18B national).

**Helicopter Money:** Direct stimulus to bottom 80% via recovered SVT ($390M since 2018). End Cantillon: First $10K/month to citizens.

**Land Reform:** City right-of-first-refusal on apartments → public/co-op housing (COPE). Leverage Villages for 60K units.

## Historical Proof and Local Precedents

| Model | Impact | Vancouver Tie-In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Québec Co-ops (1930s) | Highest density globally; Gini drop. | UCI/VALU: Arts union co-op (2025 transfer). |
| BC SVT (2018+) | $390M revenue; vacancy -20%. | Expand to Pattison estates. |
| CHF CLT (2015-2025) | 48+ units saved/developed. | Olympic Village/Railyard co-op. |
| MVA (2010s) | 100+ orgs; housing/transit wins. | 2025 listening on poverty/isolation. |

Post-WW2 BC: Top 1% share fell 42% to 18% via unions/taxes—replicate via VDLC.

## Your 30-Day Action List (Start Nov 10, 2025)

1. **Join Allies:** Sign up VDLC (vdlc.ca), UCI (unioncoopbc.ca), MVA (metvanalliance.nationbuilder.com). Attend Nov 14 Green social (bcgreens.ca).

2. **Bank Switch:** Move to Vancity—#BreakUpWithYourBank (tell them fossil ties). Track in Notion.

3. **Union/Org Drive:** Contact CUPE (cupe.bc.ca) for workplace (e.g., UBC GRAs). Start tenant union via COPE (votecope.ca).

4. **CLT/Co-op Boost:** Email CHF BC (chf.bc.ca) for tour; divert $50/month to UCI. Petition Kahlon for CLT funding.

6. **Amplify:** Post thread: "Vancouver Reset: Boycott Big Five, Build Co-ops." Tag @BCNDP, @COPVancouver, @BCGreens.

## Risks and Mitigations

**Backlash:** Developer lobbying (Wilson); counter via MVA rallies.

**Low Turnout:** Rainy Nov; virtual via Zoom (CNCLT Nov 4).

**NDP Wobble:** SVT exemptions; transparency via CityHallWatch.

## Conclusion

Vancouver—ground zero for speculation—can lead the 99% Reset: UCI co-ops starve parasites, CHF CLTs flood power, SVT funds reset. With NDP/Greens/COPE synergy and Nov events, scale nationally. The 1% (Wilson/Pattison) rule on consent—withdraw it. In 24 months, 10K unionized, 1K housed. Québec did co-ops; BC taxes; Vancouver owns. Copy. Organize. #99ResetVan.
