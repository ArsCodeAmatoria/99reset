## Executive Summary

In an era of unprecedented wealth concentration—where Canada's 61 billionaires control $324 billion amid record inequality—the 99% Reset movement proposes a non-violent strategy to redistribute power: a coordinated boycott of the Big Five banks (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC), which hold over 80% of retail deposits and financed $900 billion in fossil fuels since 2016. This paper expands on the mechanism: A targeted $10 billion deposit outflow—achievable through mass switches to credit unions—triggers credit rating reviews by agencies like Moody's and S&P, prompting investigations by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC). These probes expose systemic risks tied to billionaire lending, fueling public and political momentum for wealth taxes, as evidenced by the NDP's 2025 platform (projected $94.5 billion over four years). Drawing on historical precedents like the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956) and recent U.S. deposit runs (SVB 2023), this cascade can unlock $30 billion annually in progressive revenue, funding co-ops, CLTs, and Citizens' Wealth Funds without welfare dependency. Projected timeline: 12-24 months to policy wins.

## Introduction

Canada's financial system is a linchpin of inequality: The Big Five banks dominate with $6.5 trillion in total assets (Q1 2025), including $3-4 trillion in retail deposits, yet they enable wealth hoarding through low-wage financing and tax havens ($682 billion hidden offshore). Household debt hit $18.2 trillion in Q3 2025, higher than 2008 adjusted, as wages stagnate (-2.1% YoY real median). The 99% Reset counters this via Phase 1: Starve the parasite through boycotts, targeting $10 billion in outflows (0.25-0.33% of Big Five deposits, per Forbes/StatsCan data).

This paper dissects the chain reaction: Boycott → Rating Review → Regulatory Probe → Policy Momentum. It leverages OSFI's 2024-2025 Risk Outlook (emphasizing liquidity shocks from "abrupt deposit outflows") and NDP/C4TF advocacy (89% public support for wealth taxes). Globally, similar tactics—e.g., Third Act's 2023 U.S. bank blockades—demonstrate efficacy. By redirecting funds to credit unions ($29.6 billion revenue, +0.6% in 2025), the movement builds parallel power while destabilizing enablers of the 1%.

## Section 1: The Boycott – Engineering a $10 Billion Outflow

A bank boycott is not chaos but precision: Coordinated via #99ResetCA, participants switch deposits to ethical alternatives like Vancity or Desjardins, which grew assets 3.26% in Q1 2025 (FSRA data) amid mortgage/commercial demand. The Big Five's retail deposits total ~$3 trillion (extrapolated from RBC's $1.4 trillion assets, 70% deposit-funded); $10 billion outflow equals 0.33%, feasible with 1 million switchers averaging $10,000 each—mirroring Ontario credit unions' $3.26 billion Q1 surge.

Historical analogs abound: The 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott (381 days, 75% Black ridership boycott) cost the system $3,000/day ($30,000 today), forcing desegregation via Supreme Court ruling. In Canada, "Break Up With Your Bank" (2023-) shifted millions; scaling to $10 billion amplifies. Credit unions' stability (provincial insurance up to $250,000) ensures no systemic risk—deposits flow to member-owned institutions (+2.1% CAGR 2020-2025, IBISWorld).

Impact: Immediate liquidity strain. OSFI's Annual Risk Outlook (2024-2025) warns of "digitalization enabling abrupt outflows," as seen in SVB's 2023 $42 billion run (25% deposits in hours). For Big Five, $10 billion triggers balance sheet alerts: Loan-to-deposit ratios rise 0.3-0.5%, per PwC modeling, pressuring fossil/billionaire loans (18.3% of 2024 financing, $131 billion).

| Metric | Big Five (Aggregate) | Credit Unions (2025) | Boycott Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total Deposits/Assets | $3T (retail est.) | $29.6B revenue | -$10B outflow (0.33%) |
| Growth Rate | Stagnant (Q1 2025) | +0.6% YoY; +3.26% Q1 ON | Redirect to +$10B CU surge |
| Vulnerability | High fossil exposure ($900B since 2016) | Ethical reinvestment | Liquidity coverage &lt;133% threshold |

## Section 2: Credit Rating Review – Market Signal of Vulnerability

Outflows cascade to ratings: Agencies like S&P and Moody's monitor deposit betas (sensitivity to stress). A $10 billion hit—publicized via viral X threads—flags "funding instability," as in U.S. 2023 runs where SVB's rating dropped pre-failure (Fitch: outflows pressured profitability). Canadian precedents: Laurentian Bank's 2022 near-failure (deposit flight amid pension shortfalls) led to Moody's downgrade, OSFI intervention.

Mechanism: Ratings hinge on Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR, min. 100%; Big Five avg. 133% Q4 2024, Bank of Canada). $10 billion erodes high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by 0.75%, per IMF FSAP stress tests (2025), prompting reviews. Historical: 1985 U.S. Continental Illinois run ($10B outflow) triggered FDIC probe, leading to too-big-to-fail policies.

In Canada, OSFI's B-15 climate guideline (effective FY2025) ties ratings to fossil risks; Big Five's $131 billion 2024 fossil financing (InfluenceMap) amplifies scrutiny. Result: Negative outlooks (e.g., S&P's 2023 TD warning on outflows) hike borrowing costs 0.5-1%, squeezing billionaire loans (e.g., Wilson's Lululemon via RBC).

Projected: Within 1-3 months, announcements like "RBC Under Review" (as in 2023 U.S. contagion) erode market cap $5-10 billion, per event-study models (NBER wp24589: outflows boost gross inflows short-term but signal weakness).

## Section 3: Regulatory Investigations – OSFI and FCAC Mobilize

Ratings reviews summon regulators: OSFI, per its 2024-2025 mandate, probes "liquidity shocks" via on-site exams and data calls (e.g., new CRE loan-level reporting). $10 billion outflow breaches early warning thresholds (LAR Guideline 2025: intraday liquidity monitoring), triggering investigations into deposit stability and risk concentration.

FCAC joins for consumer protection, auditing "abrupt outflows" under Bank Act amendments (2025: enhanced CDIC coverage for FHSA/RESP). Precedent: 2022 Laurentian probe exposed mismanagement, leading to asset sales. Globally, ECB's 2023 wp2887 notes outflows prompt "destabilization" reviews, as in Credit Suisse's 2023 $100B+ run (SNB: high-value retail flight).

In Canada, probes reveal Big Five's uninsured deposits (~45%, BPI est.) and billionaire ties: E.g., $240M Thomson tax avoidance via Bermuda subsidiaries (C4TF 2025). OSFI's Financial Stability Report (2025) stresses "depositor behavior shifts," mandating reports—exposing Cantillon effects (QE to elites first).

Timeline: 3-6 months post-boycott. Outcomes: Cease-and-desist orders, fines ($100M+), and public reports fueling media (e.g., Ricochet co-ops amplify).

| Regulator | Trigger | Action | Precedent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OSFI | LCR &lt;133%; outflow &gt;0.25% | On-site exams; CRE data calls | Laurentian 2022: Deposit flight → intervention |
| FCAC | Consumer complaints surge | Audits on transparency | 2023 "Break Up" probes → ethical lending guidelines |
| CDIC | Uninsured exposure rise | Coverage reviews | 2025 FHSA updates → faster reimbursements |

## Section 4: Policy Momentum – From Probes to Wealth Taxes

Investigations catalyze reform: Exposés of billionaire-fueled risks (e.g., Pattison's oil loans) align with NDP's 2025 platform (1% wealth tax &gt;$10M, $94.5B over 4 years for pharmacare/housing). C4TF polling (89% support) amplifies; probes provide "smoking gun" data, as in U.S. post-SVB Dodd-Frank tweaks.

Historical: Montgomery Boycott (1955) cost $1M+, forcing policy via economic pain—mirroring how 1963 Birmingham boycotts (Black shoppers withheld $1M) led to desegregation. In finance, Third Act's 2023 blockades pressured JPMorgan ($1.1T fossil finance) toward divestment pledges.

In Canada, momentum peaks: NDP leverages minority government (9% vote, 25 MPs) for budget insertions (e.g., 66.7% capital gains inclusion). PBO estimates: Wealth tax yields $11-13B/year (2021-2026). Post-probe, public outrage (e.g., 2025 X virality) tips Liberals/Greens toward co-sponsorship, per 2025 FES projections.

Projected Yield: $30B/year (NDP model + loophole closures), funding Phase 2 (CLTs: 10K units) without deficits.

## Risks and Mitigations

**Counter-Mobilization:** Big Five lobbying (CBA); mitigate via media co-ops.

**Outflow Reversal:** Short-term inflows (NBER: gross funding masks net runs); sustain via 24-month campaigns.

**Systemic Spillover:** OSFI buffers (capital &gt; min.); focus on ethical redirects.

## Conclusion

A $10 billion boycott is the spark: It destabilizes ratings, unleashes probes, and ignites wealth tax momentum—transforming $324B billionaire wealth into democratic assets. As Québec co-ops and BC SVT ($390M since 2018) prove, coordinated withdrawal works. Launch via 30-day actions: Switch today. In 24 months, the 1% starves; the 99% owns.
