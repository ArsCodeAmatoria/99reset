## <JapaneseText>要約</JapaneseText> · Executive Summary

In an era of unprecedented wealth concentration—where Canada&apos;s 61 billionaires control $324 billion amid record inequality—the **99% Reset movement** proposes a non-violent strategy to redistribute power: a coordinated boycott of the **Big Five banks** (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC), which hold over 80% of retail deposits and financed $900 billion in fossil fuels since 2016.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

This paper expands on the mechanism: A targeted **$10 billion deposit outflow**—achievable through mass switches to **credit unions**—triggers credit rating reviews by agencies like Moody&apos;s and S&P, prompting investigations by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).

</Highlight>

These probes expose systemic risks tied to billionaire lending, fueling public and political momentum for **wealth taxes**, as evidenced by the NDP&apos;s 2025 platform (projected $94.5 billion over four years). Drawing on historical precedents like the **Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956)** and recent U.S. deposit runs (SVB 2023), this cascade can unlock **$30 billion annually** in progressive revenue, funding **co-ops, CLTs, and Citizens&apos; Wealth Funds** without welfare dependency.

## <JapaneseText>序章</JapaneseText> · Introduction

</ColoredSection>

Canada&apos;s financial system is a linchpin of inequality. The **Big Five banks** dominate with $6.5 trillion in total assets (Q1 2025), including $3-4 trillion in retail deposits, yet they enable wealth hoarding through low-wage financing and tax havens ($682 billion hidden offshore). Household debt hit **$18.2 trillion** in Q3 2025—higher than 2008 adjusted—as wages stagnate (-2.1% YoY real median).

The **99% Reset** counters this via **Phase 1: Starve the parasite** through boycotts, targeting $10 billion in outflows (0.25-0.33% of Big Five deposits, per Forbes/StatsCan data). This isn&apos;t just a protest—it&apos;s a strategic intervention. By redirecting funds to **credit unions** ($29.6 billion revenue, +0.6% in 2025), the movement builds parallel power while destabilizing enablers of the 1%.

<Highlight>

**The chain reaction:** Boycott → Rating Review → Regulatory Probe → Policy Momentum

</Highlight>

This paper leverages OSFI&apos;s 2024-2025 Risk Outlook (emphasizing liquidity shocks from &quot;abrupt deposit outflows&quot;) and NDP/C4TF advocacy (89% public support for wealth taxes). Globally, similar tactics—e.g., **Third Act&apos;s 2023 U.S. bank blockades**—demonstrate efficacy. Historical precedents like the **Montgomery Bus Boycott** (1955-1956) prove that coordinated economic withdrawal forces institutional change.

## 1. The Boycott – Engineering a $10 Billion Outflow
### <JapaneseText>ボイコット</JapaneseText> · Strategic Withdrawal

</ColoredSection>

A bank boycott is not chaos but **precision**. Coordinated via #99ResetCA, participants switch deposits to ethical alternatives like **Vancity** or **Desjardins**, which grew assets 3.26% in Q1 2025 (FSRA data) amid mortgage and commercial demand. The Big Five&apos;s retail deposits total approximately $3 trillion (extrapolated from RBC&apos;s $1.4 trillion assets, 70% deposit-funded). A **$10 billion outflow** equals just 0.33% of their total—feasible with 1 million switchers averaging $10,000 each, mirroring Ontario credit unions&apos; $3.26 billion Q1 surge.

<Callout type="info">

**Historical precedent:** The 1955 **Montgomery Bus Boycott** (381 days, 75% Black ridership) cost the system $3,000/day ($30,000 today), forcing desegregation via Supreme Court ruling. Economic pressure, not legislation, drove change.

</Callout>

In Canada, &quot;Break Up With Your Bank&quot; (2023-) has already shifted millions in deposits. Scaling to $10 billion amplifies this grassroots momentum exponentially. **Credit unions&apos; stability**—backed by provincial insurance up to $250,000—ensures no systemic risk. Deposits flow seamlessly to member-owned institutions that have grown at a +2.1% CAGR from 2020-2025 (IBISWorld).

<Highlight>

**Immediate impact:** Liquidity strain forces the Big Five to confront their dependence on the 99%.

</Highlight>

OSFI&apos;s Annual Risk Outlook (2024-2025) warns of &quot;digitalization enabling abrupt outflows,&quot; as seen in **SVB&apos;s 2023 collapse** where $42 billion (25% of deposits) fled in hours. For the Big Five, a $10 billion outflow triggers balance sheet alerts: Loan-to-deposit ratios rise 0.3-0.5% (per PwC modeling), pressuring their most vulnerable portfolios—**fossil fuel and billionaire loans** (18.3% of 2024 financing, $131 billion total). This is where the Reset hits hardest: starving the financial arteries that pump wealth to the 1%.

| Metric | Big Five (Aggregate) | Credit Unions (2025) | Boycott Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total Deposits/Assets | $3T (retail est.) | $29.6B revenue | -$10B outflow (0.33%) |
| Growth Rate | Stagnant (Q1 2025) | +0.6% YoY; +3.26% Q1 ON | Redirect to +$10B CU surge |
| Vulnerability | High fossil exposure ($900B since 2016) | Ethical reinvestment | Liquidity coverage &lt;133% threshold |

## 2. Credit Rating Review – Market Signal of Vulnerability
### <JapaneseText>信用格付け</JapaneseText> · The Domino Effect

</ColoredSection>

Deposit outflows cascade directly to credit ratings. Agencies like **S&P and Moody&apos;s** monitor deposit betas (sensitivity to stress). A $10 billion hit—publicized via viral X threads and grassroots campaigns—immediately flags &quot;funding instability.&quot; We&apos;ve seen this playbook before: in the U.S. 2023 bank runs, **SVB&apos;s rating dropped** pre-failure as Fitch noted that outflows pressured profitability. The Canadian precedent is equally stark: **Laurentian Bank&apos;s 2022 near-failure** (deposit flight amid pension shortfalls) led to a Moody&apos;s downgrade and swift OSFI intervention.

The mechanism is precise. Ratings hinge on **Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR)**—minimum 100%, with Big Five averaging 133% in Q4 2024 (Bank of Canada). A $10 billion erosion of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by 0.75% (per IMF FSAP stress tests, 2025) is enough to prompt formal reviews. Historically, the **1985 U.S. Continental Illinois run** ($10B outflow) triggered an FDIC probe that fundamentally reshaped &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; policies.

<Callout type="warning">

**Climate risk amplifies vulnerability:** OSFI&apos;s B-15 climate guideline (effective FY2025) ties ratings to fossil risks. The Big Five&apos;s $131 billion in 2024 fossil financing (InfluenceMap) makes them especially exposed to scrutiny.

</Callout>

**The result:** Negative outlooks (like S&P&apos;s 2023 TD warning on outflows) hike borrowing costs by 0.5-1%, squeezing the very billionaire loans (e.g., Wilson&apos;s Lululemon via RBC) that perpetuate inequality. Within 1-3 months, announcements like &quot;RBC Under Review&quot;—echoing 2023 U.S. contagion—can erode market cap by $5-10 billion (per event-study models, NBER wp24589). The signal is clear: the Big Five are vulnerable, and the Reset knows how to exploit that vulnerability.

## 3. Regulatory Investigations – OSFI and FCAC Mobilize
### <JapaneseText>規制調査</JapaneseText> · Institutional Pressure

</ColoredSection>

Credit rating reviews summon the regulators. **OSFI**, per its 2024-2025 mandate, probes &quot;liquidity shocks&quot; through on-site examinations and data calls (including new CRE loan-level reporting). A $10 billion outflow breaches early warning thresholds under the **LAR Guideline 2025** (intraday liquidity monitoring), triggering formal investigations into deposit stability and risk concentration. This isn&apos;t optional—it&apos;s mandatory regulatory response.

**FCAC** (Financial Consumer Agency of Canada) joins the fray for consumer protection, auditing &quot;abrupt outflows&quot; under Bank Act amendments (2025: enhanced CDIC coverage for FHSA/RESP). The **2022 Laurentian probe** exposed catastrophic mismanagement, leading to forced asset sales. Globally, the ECB&apos;s 2023 working paper (wp2887) notes that outflows consistently prompt &quot;destabilization&quot; reviews—witness **Credit Suisse&apos;s 2023 collapse**, where $100B+ fled in high-value retail flight (SNB data).

<Highlight>

In Canada, these probes will reveal uncomfortable truths: Big Five&apos;s **uninsured deposits** (~45%, BPI est.) and **billionaire ties**—like Thomson&apos;s $240M tax avoidance via Bermuda subsidiaries (C4TF 2025).

</Highlight>

OSFI&apos;s Financial Stability Report (2025) stresses &quot;depositor behavior shifts,&quot; mandating detailed public reports. This exposes the **Cantillon effect** in action: how QE money flows to elites first, perpetuating inequality. **Timeline: 3-6 months post-boycott.** Outcomes include cease-and-desist orders, fines ($100M+), and damning public reports that fuel grassroots media like Ricochet co-ops, amplifying the Reset narrative nationwide.

| Regulator | Trigger | Action | Precedent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OSFI | LCR &lt;133%; outflow &gt;0.25% | On-site exams; CRE data calls | Laurentian 2022: Deposit flight → intervention |
| FCAC | Consumer complaints surge | Audits on transparency | 2023 "Break Up" probes → ethical lending guidelines |
| CDIC | Uninsured exposure rise | Coverage reviews | 2025 FHSA updates → faster reimbursements |

## 4. Policy Momentum – From Probes to Wealth Taxes
### <JapaneseText>政策の勢い</JapaneseText> · The Political Cascade

</ColoredSection>

Regulatory investigations catalyze legislative reform. Exposés of billionaire-fueled risks—like **Pattison&apos;s oil loans** or **Thomson&apos;s Bermuda tax havens**—align perfectly with the **NDP&apos;s 2025 platform** (1% wealth tax on net worth >$10M, projected $94.5B over 4 years for pharmacare and housing). **C4TF polling** shows 89% public support for wealth taxes. These probes provide the &quot;smoking gun&quot; data that shifts political will, much like post-SVB reforms tweaked Dodd-Frank in the U.S.

Historical parallels are powerful. The **Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955)** cost the system over $1M, forcing policy change through economic pain—mirroring how the **1963 Birmingham boycotts** (Black shoppers withheld $1M) led to desegregation ordinances. In modern finance, **Third Act&apos;s 2023 blockades** pressured JPMorgan ($1.1T fossil finance) toward divestment pledges.

<Callout type="success">

In Canada, momentum peaks when the NDP leverages minority government power (9% vote share, 25 MPs) for budget insertions—like the **66.7% capital gains inclusion** rate. PBO estimates a wealth tax would yield **$11-13B annually** (2021-2026).

</Callout>

Post-probe, public outrage—amplified through X virality and grassroots organizing—tips **Liberals and Greens** toward co-sponsorship (per 2025 FES projections). **Projected yield: $30B/year** (NDP model + loophole closures), funding **Phase 2** initiatives like **10K CLT units** without running deficits. This is the cascade in action: boycott becomes probe becomes policy becomes redistribution.

## <JapaneseText>リスクと対策</JapaneseText> · Risks and Mitigations

</ColoredSection>

Every movement faces opposition. **Counter-mobilization** from Big Five lobbying (via the Canadian Bankers Association) is inevitable. We mitigate this through **media co-ops** like Ricochet and The Breach, which can&apos;t be captured by corporate interests.

**Outflow reversal** is a risk—NBER data shows short-term gross funding can mask net runs. We sustain momentum through **24-month campaigns** with clear benchmarks and community accountability.

**Systemic spillover** fears are overblown. OSFI buffers (capital requirements exceeding minimums) and our focus on **ethical redirects to credit unions** ensure financial stability. We&apos;re not crashing the system—we&apos;re democratizing it.

## <JapaneseText>結論</JapaneseText> · Conclusion

</ColoredSection>

A **$10 billion boycott** is the spark that lights the fire. It destabilizes credit ratings, unleashes regulatory probes, and ignites wealth tax momentum—transforming $324B in billionaire wealth into **democratic assets** owned by the 99%. As **Québec co-ops** and **BC&apos;s SVT** ($390M raised since 2018) prove, coordinated economic withdrawal works. The playbook is tested. The infrastructure exists.

<Highlight>

**Launch via 30-day actions:** Switch your bank today. In 24 months, the 1% starves while the 99% builds ownership.

</Highlight>

The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 381 days. Ours will be faster—because we have the internet, the precedents, and the **99% behind us**.
