## 要約 · Executive Summary

The 99% Reset is a **democratic socialist movement**. We're not fighting a culture war—we're fighting an **economic ownership war** against the 1%.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

**Our coalition rule:** Align with anyone who owns < $1M net worth and is willing to build **credit unions, Community Land Trusts (CLTs), worker co-ops, and unions**.

**Reject anyone**—regardless of identity—who hoards > $1M, funds the 1%, or blocks worker ownership.

</Highlight>

This paper maps **nine identity/political groups** against three Reset litmus tests:

- **Wealth position** (net worth distribution)
- **Ownership stance** (co-ops/CLTs vs. state vs. private monopoly)  
- **Action alignment** (boycotts, union drives, tax activism)

### Verdict

<Stats>
<Stat value="7 Groups" label="Core Allies: Working-class faith communities + progressives" icon="target" />
<Stat value="2 Types" label="Tactical Allies: Small capitalists (co-op converts)" icon="trending" />
<Stat value="0 Tolerance" label="Opponents: Billionaire donors + state-socialists" icon="target" />
</Stats>

<Callout type="success">

**The Reset is post-partisan, post-identity, pro-ownership.**  
We unite the 99% by **who they own**, not who they are.

## 1. The Three Litmus Tests
### 三つの試金石 · Three Tests of Alliance

| Test | Question | Pass Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Wealth** | Where are you in the 99% vs. 1%? | < $1M net worth (StatsCan 2025: 99% threshold) |
| **Ownership** | Do you want worker/community ownership or state/private monopoly? | Supports credit unions, CLTs, worker co-ops, unions; rejects state seizure & corporate monopoly |
| **Action** | Will you switch to credit unions, build CLTs, unionize, form co-ops? | Joins #99ResetVan drives: bank boycotts, CLT formation, union organizing |

</ColoredSection>

## 2. Group-by-Group Alignment Matrix

| Group | Wealth Position | Ownership Stance | Action Alignment | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Working-Class Jews | 95% &lt; $1M (Pew 2025) | Strong co-op tradition (kibbutzim, credit unions) | High (e.g., JVP boycotts, DSA Jewish caucus) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Working-Class Muslims | 97% &lt; $1M (ISPU 2025) | Zakat funds co-ops; anti-usury aligns with credit unions | High (e.g., Mamdani's base, CAIR tenant unions) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Working-Class Christians | 96% &lt; $1M (PRRI 2025) | Catholic Worker co-ops; evangelical mutual aid | Medium-High (e.g., Sojourners, labor priests) | **CORE ALLY** |
| LGBTQ | 92% &lt; $1M (UCLA 2025) | Rainbow co-ops (e.g., Toronto's Pride Housing) | High (e.g., trans tenant unions, drag co-op venues) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Democratic Socialists (DSA) | 99% &lt; $1M | Democratic socialist model: credit unions, worker co-ops, CLTs, strong unions (Mamdani, Kshama Sawant) | Very High (union drives, CLT campaigns, credit union conversions) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Democratic Socialists (Electoral) | 98% &lt; $1M | Tax the rich → fund CLTs, co-ops, credit unions (Mamdani's NYC model) | High (uses state power to build worker ownership) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Progressives | 90% &lt; $1M | NDP/Greens: SVT, co-op funding | High (BC NDP's $90M SVT revenue) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Small Capitalists | 85% &lt; $1M | Co-op converts (e.g., Vancity members, UCI builders) | Medium (if they sell 2% equity/year) | **TACTICAL ALLY** |
| State-Socialists | Varies | State ownership (Cuba/Venezuela model) | Low (rejects co-ops) | **OPPONENT** |

## 3. Core Allies: The 99% Ownership Bloc
### 同盟 · Allies United by Ownership

</ColoredSection>

### Working-Class Jews, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ

<Callout type="success">

**Why they're allies:** Shared economic pain (rents, wages) + **deep co-op traditions** (kibbutzim, zakat, Catholic Worker, rainbow housing)

</Callout>

**Action in practice:**

- **Jews** → DSA Jewish caucus runs **co-op bakeries**
- **Muslims** → Mosque credit unions (e.g., *UMAA in Vancouver*)
- **Christians** → Labor priest **union drives** (VDLC faith caucus)
- **LGBTQ** → **Pride CLTs** (Toronto model → Vancouver)

### Democratic Socialists & Progressives

<Highlight>

**Why they're core allies:** They build the four pillars—**credit unions, CLTs, worker co-ops, and unions**. Mamdani's **$4B tax win** funds the Reset.

</Highlight>

**Action:**

- **DSA:** Unionize Amazon/Lululemon, build **worker co-ops**, convert banks to **credit unions**
- **NDP/Greens:** Speculation & Vacancy Tax → **CLT funding** (**$90M/year**), support **credit union** growth

## 4. Tactical Allies: Small Capitalists (The Co-op Converts)

| Type | Example | How to Convert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credit Union Members | Vancity (500K) | Switch campaign → $500M boycott |
| Co-op Suppliers | UCI builders | 2% equity sale (Colorado law) |
| Ethical Investors | Patriotic Millionaires Canada | Wealth tax petition |

**Rule:** They stay allies only if they vest equity to workers.

## 5. Opponents: The 1% in Any Clothing
### 敵 · Enemies Regardless of Identity

| Group | Example | Why Opposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Billionaire Donors** | Chip Wilson (Lululemon), Jim Pattison | Anti-union, speculation |
| **State-Socialists** | Tankies, CPUSA hardliners | Reject co-ops for state seizure |
| **Corporate Progressives** | Bloomberg (anti-Mamdani PAC) | Tax the rich… but not me |

<Callout type="warning">

**No exceptions. Wealth > $1M = enemy.**

Your identity doesn't matter. Your ownership does.

## 7. Why This Works: Post-Identity, Pro-Ownership
### 所有権 > アイデンティティ · Ownership > Identity

| Identity Politics | 99% Reset |
| --- | --- |
| Divides by **who you are** | Unites by **who you own** |
| State as savior | Co-ops as owner |
| Culture war | **Class war** |

## Deep Dive: Why Co-op Traditions Matter
### 深掘り · In-Depth Analysis

</ColoredSection>

### Jewish Co-op Heritage: Kibbutzim to Credit Unions

<Callout type="info">

**Historical precedent:**

- **1909:** First kibbutz (Degania) = worker-owned farm collective
- **By 1948:** 270+ kibbutzim, 5% of Israeli population  
- **Today:** Credit unions dominate Jewish financial planning (*Amalgamated Bank, Labor Lyric*)

</Callout>

**Reset application:**

- *DSA Jewish caucus:* 20+ co-op bakeries, community fridges
- *Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP):* BDS = economic boycott model
- **Alignment:** Anti-usury tradition + co-op economics = natural Reset partners

### Muslim Economic Justice: Zakat to Co-ops

<Callout type="success">

**Islamic finance principles:**

- **Riba (usury) forbidden** → credit unions over banks
- **Zakat (2.5% wealth tax)** → wealth redistribution built-in
- **Shura (consultation)** → democratic decision-making

</Callout>

**Reset application:**

- *Mamdani's NYC base:* Muslim working-class communities (Queens, Bronx)
- *CAIR tenant unions:* Fighting landlord exploitation
- *Mosque credit unions:* UMAA (Vancouver), Islamic Co-operative Housing Corp (Toronto)

<Highlight>

**Why they're core allies:** Islam's economic model **IS** the Reset—zakat = wealth fund, shura = co-op democracy, riba-free = credit unions.

</Highlight>

### Christian Liberation Theology: Catholic Worker to Labor Priests

**Historical precedent:**
- 1933: Dorothy Day founds Catholic Worker (co-op farms, hospitality houses)
- 1960s-70s: Liberation theology in Latin America (co-op emphasis)
- Today: Labor priests organize unions (e.g., VDLC faith caucus)

**Reset application:**
- Evangelical mutual aid networks (food co-ops, childcare collectives)
- Sojourners: Faith-based housing justice
- Alignment: "Preferential option for the poor" = worker ownership

### LGBTQ Economic Survival: From Oppression to Ownership

<Callout type="info">

**Why they're natural allies:**

- **40%** face workplace discrimination → higher unemployment → need co-ops
- Housing discrimination → need CLTs (e.g., *Pride Housing Toronto*)
- Drag venues shut down by gentrification → need worker-owned spaces

</Callout>

**Reset application:**

- *Trans tenant unions* (fighting evictions)
- *Rainbow co-ops* (queer-owned cafes, bookstores, bars)
- *Pride CLTs* (permanent affordable LGBTQ housing)

<Highlight>

**Slogan:** *"We survived hate. Now we'll survive capitalism—by owning it."*

</Highlight>

## The Small Capitalist Question: Convert or Confront?

**Who are they?**
- Vancity members (500K): $35B assets, but still deposit-holders (not oligarchs)
- Small landlords (1-3 properties): Net worth $500K-$1M
- Co-op suppliers: Contractors building UCI projects

**Conversion strategy:**
1. **Credit union members:** Switch campaign (redirect Big 5 deposits to Vancity) = allies
2. **Small landlords:** Offer to buy properties for CLTs at 110% market (exit with profit + legacy)
3. **Co-op suppliers:** Colorado law model—sell 2% equity/year to worker trust

**If they refuse?** Treat as opponents (vacancy tax at 500%, union drives, boycotts).

**Rule:** Ownership trajectory matters. Moving toward worker ownership = ally. Hoarding = enemy.

## Why State-Socialists Are Opponents (Not Allies)

**Definition:** Those who want state seizure of assets (Cuba/Venezuela model) instead of co-op ownership.

**Why they oppose us:**
- Reject market + democracy (see co-ops as "capitalism")
- Want central planning (see worker votes as "chaos")
- Align with authoritarian regimes (Syria, North Korea)

**Our response:**
- "State ownership failed (Soviet collapse). Co-ops succeeded (Mondragón 70 years)."
- "We don't need the state to own factories. Workers own them."
- "Your model made the state the new 1%. Ours makes the 99% the owners."

**Coalition rule:** If they support co-ops/CLTs, welcome them. If they demand state control, exclude them.

## The Billionaire Donor Trap: No Exceptions

**Danger:** Progressive billionaires (e.g., Soros, Buffett) who fund left causes but oppose wealth redistribution.

**Example:**
- Bloomberg: Gave $1B to Johns Hopkins, ran $40M anti-Mamdani campaign
- Gates: Funds global health, but offshore $150B via tax havens
- Thiel: Funded Trump, but also some libertarian co-ops

**Coalition rule:** Wealth &gt; $1M = opponent, even if they donate to our causes.

**Why?** They give crumbs to buy legitimacy. We want the bakery.

**Test:** "Will you sell 80% of your wealth to a Citizens' Wealth Fund?"
- If yes → ally (Patriotic Millionaires Canada)
- If no → opponent (Bloomberg)

## Vancouver 2025 Playbook: Building the Coalition

### November 14, 2025: Interfaith Co-op Summit

**Location:** Vancouver Central Mosque + Beth Israel Synagogue + Christ Church Cathedral (rotating hosts)

**Agenda:**
1. Rabbi, Imam, Priest panel: "Co-ops in Our Traditions"
2. Breakout: Bank boycott (Jews), credit unions (Muslims), labor priests (Christians)
3. Commit: 1,000 switchers by Dec 31 ($100M to Vancity)

**Why it works:** Shared scripture (anti-usury, jubilee, zakat) + shared enemy (Big 5 banks).

### December 2025: Pride CLT Launch

**Model:** Toronto's Pride Housing (50 units, 0% flips since 2018)

**Target:** East Van (Commercial Drive)—gentrifying queer neighborhood

**Funding:** BC SVT revenue ($90M) + private bonds ($5M from allies)

**Goal:** 100 units by 2027 (permanent affordable LGBTQ housing)

### January 2026: Mamdani North Townhall

**Invite:** Mamdani (NYC), Kshama Sawant (Seattle), COPE (Vancouver)

**Topic:** "How Electoral Wins Fund Co-ops"

**Ask:** NDP to redirect SVT → UCI co-op fund ($10M/year)

### March 2026: Vancity Equity Sale Campaign

**Target:** 500K members vote to convert Vancity to full worker co-op

**Mechanism:** 2% equity sale annually (Colorado law model)

**Result:** 100K worker-owners by 2030
