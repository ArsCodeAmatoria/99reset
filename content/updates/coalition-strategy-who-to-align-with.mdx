## <JapaneseText>要約</JapaneseText> · Executive Summary

The 99% Reset is a **democratic socialist movement**. We're not fighting a culture war—we're fighting an **economic ownership war** against the 1%.

</ColoredSection>

<Highlight>

**Our coalition rule:** Align with anyone who owns < $1M net worth and is willing to build **credit unions, Community Land Trusts (CLTs), worker co-ops, and unions**.

**Reject anyone**—regardless of identity—who hoards > $1M, funds the 1%, or blocks worker ownership.

</Highlight>

This paper maps **nine identity/political groups** against three Reset litmus tests. First, **wealth position**: where do they fall in the 99% vs. 1% divide based on net worth distribution? Second, **ownership stance**: do they support credit unions, Community Land Trusts, worker cooperatives, and unions—or do they advocate for state control or defend private monopolies? Third, **action alignment**: will they actually join bank boycotts, organize union drives, build cooperatives, and campaign for progressive taxation? Identity tells us nothing. These three tests tell us everything.

### Verdict

## 3. Core Allies: The 99% Ownership Bloc
### <JapaneseText>同盟</JapaneseText> · Allies United by Ownership

</ColoredSection>

### Working-Class Jews, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ

<Callout type="success">

These communities aren't just theoretical allies—they're natural partners in the democratic socialist movement. What unites them isn't identity politics, but **shared economic pain** and **centuries-old cooperative traditions** that align perfectly with the Reset's four pillars.

</Callout>

Working-class Jews bring a powerful legacy of collective organizing through the **kibbutz movement** and credit union traditions. Today, the DSA Jewish caucus operates over 20 **cooperative bakeries** and community fridges across North America, demonstrating that Jewish cooperative values remain alive and actionable. Their experience with economic boycotts through movements like Jewish Voice for Peace provides a proven template for our bank boycott campaigns.

Muslim communities offer perhaps the clearest alignment with democratic socialist economics. Islamic finance principles—**riba** (usury) prohibition, **zakat** (2.5% wealth redistribution), and **shura** (democratic consultation)—are essentially the Reset model written into religious law. Mosque **credit unions** like UMAA in Vancouver and the Islamic Co-operative Housing Corp in Toronto show this isn't theoretical. These institutions are already building the alternative economy we need.

The Christian worker tradition, from Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker farms to today's **labor priest union drives** through the VDLC faith caucus, demonstrates that liberation theology isn't dead—it's being practiced daily. Evangelical mutual aid networks and Sojourners' faith-based housing justice campaigns prove that Christian cooperative economics crosses denominational lines. The "preferential option for the poor" becomes real when it means **worker ownership**.

LGBTQ communities, facing 40% workplace discrimination and systematic housing exclusion, have the most immediate economic motivation for cooperative structures. **Pride Community Land Trusts** like Toronto's Pride Housing (50 units with 0% turnover since 2018) demonstrate that when queer people control their own housing, gentrification loses. Trans tenant unions fighting evictions and worker-owned drag venues show that survival under capitalism demands **collective ownership**.

### Democratic Socialists & Progressives

<Highlight>

Democratic socialists aren't just ideological allies—they're the **institutional builders** constructing the Reset's infrastructure right now. They control the levers that turn electoral victories into permanent economic change.

</Highlight>

The Democratic Socialists of America represents the Reset's organizing muscle. DSA chapters are simultaneously **unionizing Amazon warehouses and Lululemon stores**, building **worker cooperatives** from scratch, and running campaigns to convert Big Five bank branches into **credit unions**. This isn't single-issue activism—it's coordinated construction of the alternative economy. When Zara Mamdani's democratic socialist campaign won New York and delivered a **$4 billion tax increase on the wealthy**, that wasn't symbolic victory. That was Phase 1 capital accumulation for the Citizens' Wealth Fund.

Progressive parties like the NDP and Greens provide the policy infrastructure. British Columbia's Speculation and Vacancy Tax generates **$90 million annually**—revenue that democratic socialists are now redirecting toward **CLT land acquisition** and **credit union** seed funding. This is how electoral power becomes economic power: tax the 1%, fund the cooperative economy, lock in permanent worker ownership. The state isn't the solution—it's the **leverage** that makes worker ownership irreversible.

## 4. Tactical Allies: Small Capitalists (The Co-op Converts)

| Type | Example | How to Convert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credit Union Members | Vancity (500K) | Switch campaign → $500M boycott |
| Co-op Suppliers | UCI builders | 2% equity sale (Colorado law) |
| Ethical Investors | Patriotic Millionaires Canada | Wealth tax petition |

**Rule:** They stay allies only if they vest equity to workers.

## Deep Dive: Why Co-op Traditions Matter
### <JapaneseText>深掘り</JapaneseText> · In-Depth Analysis

</ColoredSection>

### Jewish Co-op Heritage: Kibbutzim to Credit Unions

<Callout type="info">

The **kibbutz movement** provides undeniable historical proof that Jewish communities can build and sustain cooperative economics at scale. When the first kibbutz, Degania, emerged in 1909 as a worker-owned farm collective, it wasn't an experiment—it was a template. By 1948, **270+ kibbutzim** housed 5% of Israel's entire population, demonstrating that collective ownership could scale beyond small communes. Today, that tradition lives on through credit unions that dominate Jewish financial planning, from Amalgamated Bank to Labor Lyric, proving the model's durability across generations and geographies.

</Callout>

For the Reset, this isn't ancient history—it's **active infrastructure**. The DSA Jewish caucus operates over 20 **cooperative bakeries** and community fridges across North America right now. Jewish Voice for Peace's BDS campaign provides the economic boycott model our bank switching campaigns are built on. The alignment is organic: Jewish anti-usury traditions flow naturally into credit union economics, and kibbutz cooperative principles map directly onto CLTs and worker co-ops. We're not converting people—we're reviving what capitalism suppressed.

### Muslim Economic Justice: Zakat to Co-ops

<Callout type="success">

**Islamic finance principles** aren't just compatible with democratic socialism—they're essentially identical. **Riba** (usury) prohibition means credit unions over extractive banks. **Zakat** (mandatory 2.5% wealth redistribution) is a Citizens' Wealth Fund written into religious law. **Shura** (consultative decision-making) is cooperative democracy under another name. When Muslim communities practice authentic Islamic economics, they're building the Reset whether they use that language or not.

</Callout>

The evidence is everywhere. Zara Mamdani's democratic socialist campaign won New York by organizing Muslim working-class communities in Queens and the Bronx around **economic justice**, not identity politics. CAIR's tenant unions fight landlord exploitation using Islamic solidarity principles. Mosque credit unions like **UMAA in Vancouver** and the Islamic Co-operative Housing Corp in Toronto demonstrate that riba-free finance creates real alternatives to Big Five banks. These aren't fringe experiments—they're established institutions serving thousands of families.

<Highlight>

**Why Muslims are core allies:** Islam's economic model **IS** the democratic socialist Reset. Zakat equals the wealth fund. Shura equals cooperative democracy. Riba-free banking equals credit unions. The alignment is total.

</Highlight>

### Christian Liberation Theology: Catholic Worker to Labor Priests

**Historical precedent:**
- 1933: Dorothy Day founds Catholic Worker (co-op farms, hospitality houses)
- 1960s-70s: Liberation theology in Latin America (co-op emphasis)
- Today: Labor priests organize unions (e.g., VDLC faith caucus)

**Reset application:**
- Evangelical mutual aid networks (food co-ops, childcare collectives)
- Sojourners: Faith-based housing justice
- Alignment: "Preferential option for the poor" = worker ownership

### LGBTQ Economic Survival: From Oppression to Ownership

<Callout type="info">

**LGBTQ communities** face economic violence that makes cooperative ownership a survival necessity, not ideological preference. When **40% face workplace discrimination**, the unemployment crisis isn't about individual bigotry—it's systematic exclusion that only worker cooperatives can solve. When housing discrimination forces queer people into unstable rentals, the answer isn't better anti-discrimination laws (though those help)—it's **Community Land Trusts** that can never evict based on identity. When gentrification shuts down drag venues and queer bars, the solution is **worker-owned spaces** that capital can't displace.

</Callout>

The Reset application is already happening. **Trans tenant unions** are fighting evictions using collective power where individual legal challenges fail. **Rainbow cooperatives**—queer-owned cafes, bookstores, and bars—demonstrate that LGBTQ spaces survive when the community owns them, not when landlords tolerate them. **Pride Community Land Trusts** like Toronto's Pride Housing (50 units with 0% turnover since 2018) prove that when queer people control land collectively, gentrification loses its weapon. These aren't feel-good projects—they're battle-tested survival strategies.

<Highlight>

**The LGBTQ slogan** captures it perfectly: *"We survived hate. Now we'll survive capitalism—by owning it."* Liberation through ownership, not legislation.

</Highlight>

## The Small Capitalist Question: Convert or Confront?

**Who are they?**
- Vancity members (500K): $35B assets, but still deposit-holders (not oligarchs)
- Small landlords (1-3 properties): Net worth $500K-$1M
- Co-op suppliers: Contractors building UCI projects

**Conversion strategy:**
1. **Credit union members:** Switch campaign (redirect Big 5 deposits to Vancity) = allies
2. **Small landlords:** Offer to buy properties for CLTs at 110% market (exit with profit + legacy)
3. **Co-op suppliers:** Colorado law model—sell 2% equity/year to worker trust

**If they refuse?** Treat as opponents (vacancy tax at 500%, union drives, boycotts).

**Rule:** Ownership trajectory matters. Moving toward worker ownership = ally. Hoarding = enemy.

## Why State-Socialists Are Opponents (Not Allies)

**Definition:** Those who want state seizure of assets (Cuba/Venezuela model) instead of co-op ownership.

**Why they oppose us:**
- Reject market + democracy (see co-ops as "capitalism")
- Want central planning (see worker votes as "chaos")
- Align with authoritarian regimes (Syria, North Korea)

**Our response:**
- "State ownership failed (Soviet collapse). Co-ops succeeded (Mondragón 70 years)."
- "We don't need the state to own factories. Workers own them."
- "Your model made the state the new 1%. Ours makes the 99% the owners."

**Coalition rule:** If they support co-ops/CLTs, welcome them. If they demand state control, exclude them.

## The Billionaire Donor Trap: No Exceptions

**Danger:** Progressive billionaires (e.g., Soros, Buffett) who fund left causes but oppose wealth redistribution.

**Example:**
- Bloomberg: Gave $1B to Johns Hopkins, ran $40M anti-Mamdani campaign
- Gates: Funds global health, but offshore $150B via tax havens
- Thiel: Funded Trump, but also some libertarian co-ops

**Coalition rule:** Wealth &gt; $1M = opponent, even if they donate to our causes.

**Why?** They give crumbs to buy legitimacy. We want the bakery.

**Test:** "Will you sell 80% of your wealth to a Citizens' Wealth Fund?"
- If yes → ally (Patriotic Millionaires Canada)
- If no → opponent (Bloomberg)

## Vancouver 2025 Playbook: Building the Coalition

### November 14, 2025: Interfaith Co-op Summit

**Location:** Vancouver Central Mosque + Beth Israel Synagogue + Christ Church Cathedral (rotating hosts)

**Agenda:**
1. Rabbi, Imam, Priest panel: "Co-ops in Our Traditions"
2. Breakout: Bank boycott (Jews), credit unions (Muslims), labor priests (Christians)
3. Commit: 1,000 switchers by Dec 31 ($100M to Vancity)

**Why it works:** Shared scripture (anti-usury, jubilee, zakat) + shared enemy (Big 5 banks).

### December 2025: Pride CLT Launch

**Model:** Toronto's Pride Housing (50 units, 0% flips since 2018)

**Target:** East Van (Commercial Drive)—gentrifying queer neighborhood

**Funding:** BC SVT revenue ($90M) + private bonds ($5M from allies)

**Goal:** 100 units by 2027 (permanent affordable LGBTQ housing)

### January 2026: Mamdani North Townhall

**Invite:** Mamdani (NYC), Kshama Sawant (Seattle), COPE (Vancouver)

**Topic:** "How Electoral Wins Fund Co-ops"

**Ask:** NDP to redirect SVT → UCI co-op fund ($10M/year)

### March 2026: Vancity Equity Sale Campaign

**Target:** 500K members vote to convert Vancity to full worker co-op

**Mechanism:** 2% equity sale annually (Colorado law model)

**Result:** 100K worker-owners by 2030

## For Organizers: Talking Points
### <JapaneseText>オーガナイザー向け</JapaneseText> · Organizer Toolkit

</ColoredSection>

### When recruiting allies:

<Callout type="tip">

The recruitment pitch is simple and direct: **ownership determines solidarity, not identity**. When approaching a potential ally, start with the fundamental question: *"Do you own your workplace?"* When they answer no, the follow-up is immediate: *"Then you're one of us."* This cuts through every identity category and lands on material reality.

For faith communities, revival language resonates powerfully. Mosques, synagogues, and churches all have **cooperative heritage** buried in their traditions—kibbutzim, zakat funds, Catholic Worker farms. The pitch isn't to create something new, but to **revive what was stolen** by capitalism. Frame it as returning to authentic practice, not radical innovation.

With LGBTQ communities, the connection between **rights and ownership** is obvious once articulated. Pride isn't just about legal recognition—it's about **owning the spaces** where queer people gather, live, and work. When drag venues get gentrified out and trans people face housing discrimination, the solution isn't more legislation. It's **Community Land Trusts** and worker-owned cooperative spaces that can't be displaced by capital.

</Callout>

### When rejecting opponents:

<Callout type="warning">

Clarity on opposition is just as important as solidarity. When someone worth $5 million claims to be an ally, the response is stark: *"Sell $4 million to the Citizens' Wealth Fund, or you're on the wrong side."* There's no middle ground on wealth accumulation. The $1 million threshold isn't arbitrary—it's the **line between the 99% and the 1%**, and crossing it means choosing sides.

For state-socialists advocating central planning over cooperative ownership, the historical record speaks clearly. The USSR's state ownership model collapsed. Cuba and Venezuela's command economies failed to build worker power. Meanwhile, **Mondragón cooperatives** have thrived for 70 years. Democratic ownership works. State control doesn't. If someone demands state seizure instead of worker cooperatives, they're not allies—they're replicating the authoritarianism that already failed.

Corporate progressives present the trickiest opposition because they fund left causes while **blocking structural change**. Bloomberg gave $1 billion to Johns Hopkins but spent $40 million defeating Mamdani's democratic socialist campaign. Gates funds global health while hiding $150 billion offshore. The test is simple: **Will you redistribute your wealth or just donate its crumbs?** Philanthropy without wealth redistribution is legitimacy-buying, not solidarity.

</Callout>

<Highlight>

**The unifying frame** cuts through all complexity: In 20 years, either billionaires own everything, or the 99% does. There's no third path. Every person, every organization, every movement must choose which future they're building. Neutrality is impossible when ownership is being contested. The question isn't whether you'll pick a side—it's whether you'll pick the **winning side**.
