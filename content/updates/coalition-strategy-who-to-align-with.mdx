## Executive Summary

The 99% Reset is not a culture war. It is an economic ownership war against the 1%.

Our coalition rule: **Align with anyone who owns &lt; $1M net worth and is willing to build co-ops, CLTs, unions, or wealth funds**.

Reject anyone—regardless of identity—who hoards &gt; $1M, funds the 1%, or blocks worker ownership.

This paper maps nine identity/political groups against three Reset litmus tests:
- Wealth position (net worth distribution)
- Ownership stance (co-ops/CLTs vs. state vs. private monopoly)
- Action alignment (boycotts, union drives, tax activism)

Verdict:
- **Core allies:** Working-class Jews, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ, socialists, democratic socialists, progressives
- **Tactical allies:** Small capitalists (co-op converts)
- **Opponents:** Billionaire donors in any group; state-socialists who reject co-ops

The Reset is post-partisan, post-identity, pro-ownership. We unite the 99% by who they own, not who they are.

## 1. The Three Litmus Tests

| Test | Question | Pass Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wealth | Where are you in the 99% vs. 1%? | &lt; $1M net worth (StatsCan 2025: 99% threshold) |
| Ownership | Do you want worker/community ownership or state/private monopoly? | Supports co-ops/CLTs/funds; rejects state seizure |
| Action | Will you boycott banks, unionize, build co-ops? | Joins #99ResetVan drives |

## 2. Group-by-Group Alignment Matrix

| Group | Wealth Position | Ownership Stance | Action Alignment | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Working-Class Jews | 95% &lt; $1M (Pew 2025) | Strong co-op tradition (kibbutzim, credit unions) | High (e.g., JVP boycotts, DSA Jewish caucus) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Working-Class Muslims | 97% &lt; $1M (ISPU 2025) | Zakat funds co-ops; anti-usury aligns with credit unions | High (e.g., Mamdani's base, CAIR tenant unions) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Working-Class Christians | 96% &lt; $1M (PRRI 2025) | Catholic Worker co-ops; evangelical mutual aid | Medium-High (e.g., Sojourners, labor priests) | **CORE ALLY** |
| LGBTQ | 92% &lt; $1M (UCLA 2025) | Rainbow co-ops (e.g., Toronto's Pride Housing) | High (e.g., trans tenant unions, drag co-op venues) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Socialists (DSA-style) | 99% &lt; $1M | Co-op socialists (Mamdani, Kshama Sawant) | Very High (union drives, CLTs) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Democratic Socialists | 98% &lt; $1M | Mamdani's NYC model: tax → public alternatives | High (but state-reliant) | **TACTICAL ALLY** |
| Progressives | 90% &lt; $1M | NDP/Greens: SVT, co-op funding | High (BC NDP's $90M SVT revenue) | **CORE ALLY** |
| Small Capitalists | 85% &lt; $1M | Co-op converts (e.g., Vancity members, UCI builders) | Medium (if they sell 2% equity/year) | **TACTICAL ALLY** |
| State-Socialists | Varies | State ownership (Cuba/Venezuela model) | Low (rejects co-ops) | **OPPONENT** |

## 3. Core Allies: The 99% Ownership Bloc

### Working-Class Jews, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ

**Why:** Shared economic pain (rents, wages) + co-op traditions (kibbutzim, zakat, Catholic Worker, rainbow housing)

**Action:**
- **Jews:** DSA Jewish caucus runs co-op bakeries
- **Muslims:** Mosque credit unions (e.g., UMAA in Vancouver)
- **Christians:** Labor priest union drives (VDLC faith caucus)
- **LGBTQ:** Pride CLTs (Toronto model → Vancouver)

### Socialists & Progressives

**Why:** Mamdani's $4B tax win = Reset Phase 1 accelerator

**Action:**
- **DSA:** Unionize Amazon/Lululemon
- **NDP/Greens:** SVT → CLT funding ($90M/year)

## 4. Tactical Allies: Small Capitalists (The Co-op Converts)

| Type | Example | How to Convert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credit Union Members | Vancity (500K) | Switch campaign → $500M boycott |
| Co-op Suppliers | UCI builders | 2% equity sale (Colorado law) |
| Ethical Investors | Patriotic Millionaires Canada | Wealth tax petition |

**Rule:** They stay allies only if they vest equity to workers.

## 5. Opponents: The 1% in Any Clothing

| Group | Example | Why Opposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Billionaire Donors | Chip Wilson (Lululemon), Jim Pattison | Anti-union, speculation |
| State-Socialists | Tankies, CPUSA hardliners | Reject co-ops for state seizure |
| Corporate Progressives | Bloomberg (anti-Mamdani PAC) | Tax the rich… but not me |

**No exceptions. Wealth &gt; $1M = enemy.**

## 6. Coalition Playbook: Vancouver 2025–2026

| Month | Action | Allies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nov 2025 | Interfaith Co-op Summit (mosque, synagogue, church) | Jews, Muslims, Christians |
| Dec 2025 | Pride CLT Launch (East Van) | LGBTQ, tenant unions |
| Jan 2026 | Mamdani North Townhall (with DSA, NDP) | Socialists, progressives |
| Mar 2026 | Vancity Equity Sale Campaign | Small capitalists |

**Slogan:** "Your identity doesn't matter. Your ownership does."

## 7. Why This Works: Post-Identity, Pro-Ownership

| Identity Politics | 99% Reset |
| --- | --- |
| Divides by who you are | Unites by who you own |
| State as savior | Co-ops as owner |
| Culture war | Class war |

**The 1% want you fighting over pronouns, prayers, or passports.**

**The Reset fights over who owns the bakery.**

## Deep Dive: Why Co-op Traditions Matter

### Jewish Co-op Heritage: Kibbutzim to Credit Unions

**Historical precedent:**
- 1909: First kibbutz (Degania) = worker-owned farm collective
- By 1948: 270+ kibbutzim, 5% of Israeli population
- Today: Credit unions dominate Jewish financial planning (Amalgamated Bank, Labor Lyric)

**Reset application:**
- DSA Jewish caucus: 20+ co-op bakeries, community fridges
- Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP): BDS = economic boycott model
- Alignment: Anti-usury tradition + co-op economics = natural Reset partners

### Muslim Economic Justice: Zakat to Co-ops

**Islamic finance principles:**
- Riba (usury) forbidden → credit unions over banks
- Zakat (2.5% wealth tax) → wealth redistribution built-in
- Shura (consultation) → democratic decision-making

**Reset application:**
- Mamdani's NYC base: Muslim working-class communities (Queens, Bronx)
- CAIR tenant unions: Fighting landlord exploitation
- Mosque credit unions: UMAA (Vancouver), Islamic Co-operative Housing Corp (Toronto)

**Why they're core allies:** Islam's economic model **is** the Reset—zakat = wealth fund, shura = co-op democracy, riba-free = credit unions.

### Christian Liberation Theology: Catholic Worker to Labor Priests

**Historical precedent:**
- 1933: Dorothy Day founds Catholic Worker (co-op farms, hospitality houses)
- 1960s-70s: Liberation theology in Latin America (co-op emphasis)
- Today: Labor priests organize unions (e.g., VDLC faith caucus)

**Reset application:**
- Evangelical mutual aid networks (food co-ops, childcare collectives)
- Sojourners: Faith-based housing justice
- Alignment: "Preferential option for the poor" = worker ownership

### LGBTQ Economic Survival: From Oppression to Ownership

**Why they're natural allies:**
- 40% face workplace discrimination → higher unemployment → need co-ops
- Housing discrimination → need CLTs (e.g., Pride Housing Toronto)
- Drag venues shut down by gentrification → need worker-owned spaces

**Reset application:**
- Trans tenant unions (fighting evictions)
- Rainbow co-ops (queer-owned cafes, bookstores, bars)
- Pride CLTs (permanent affordable LGBTQ housing)

**Slogan:** "We survived hate. Now we'll survive capitalism—by owning it."

## The Small Capitalist Question: Convert or Confront?

**Who are they?**
- Vancity members (500K): $35B assets, but still deposit-holders (not oligarchs)
- Small landlords (1-3 properties): Net worth $500K-$1M
- Co-op suppliers: Contractors building UCI projects

**Conversion strategy:**
1. **Credit union members:** Switch campaign (redirect Big 5 deposits to Vancity) = allies
2. **Small landlords:** Offer to buy properties for CLTs at 110% market (exit with profit + legacy)
3. **Co-op suppliers:** Colorado law model—sell 2% equity/year to worker trust

**If they refuse?** Treat as opponents (vacancy tax at 500%, union drives, boycotts).

**Rule:** Ownership trajectory matters. Moving toward worker ownership = ally. Hoarding = enemy.

## Why State-Socialists Are Opponents (Not Allies)

**Definition:** Those who want state seizure of assets (Cuba/Venezuela model) instead of co-op ownership.

**Why they oppose us:**
- Reject market + democracy (see co-ops as "capitalism")
- Want central planning (see worker votes as "chaos")
- Align with authoritarian regimes (Syria, North Korea)

**Our response:**
- "State ownership failed (Soviet collapse). Co-ops succeeded (Mondragón 70 years)."
- "We don't need the state to own factories. Workers own them."
- "Your model made the state the new 1%. Ours makes the 99% the owners."

**Coalition rule:** If they support co-ops/CLTs, welcome them. If they demand state control, exclude them.

## The Billionaire Donor Trap: No Exceptions

**Danger:** Progressive billionaires (e.g., Soros, Buffett) who fund left causes but oppose wealth redistribution.

**Example:**
- Bloomberg: Gave $1B to Johns Hopkins, ran $40M anti-Mamdani campaign
- Gates: Funds global health, but offshore $150B via tax havens
- Thiel: Funded Trump, but also some libertarian co-ops

**Coalition rule:** Wealth &gt; $1M = opponent, even if they donate to our causes.

**Why?** They give crumbs to buy legitimacy. We want the bakery.

**Test:** "Will you sell 80% of your wealth to a Citizens' Wealth Fund?"
- If yes → ally (Patriotic Millionaires Canada)
- If no → opponent (Bloomberg)

## Vancouver 2025 Playbook: Building the Coalition

### November 14, 2025: Interfaith Co-op Summit

**Location:** Vancouver Central Mosque + Beth Israel Synagogue + Christ Church Cathedral (rotating hosts)

**Agenda:**
1. Rabbi, Imam, Priest panel: "Co-ops in Our Traditions"
2. Breakout: Bank boycott (Jews), credit unions (Muslims), labor priests (Christians)
3. Commit: 1,000 switchers by Dec 31 ($100M to Vancity)

**Why it works:** Shared scripture (anti-usury, jubilee, zakat) + shared enemy (Big 5 banks).

### December 2025: Pride CLT Launch

**Model:** Toronto's Pride Housing (50 units, 0% flips since 2018)

**Target:** East Van (Commercial Drive)—gentrifying queer neighborhood

**Funding:** BC SVT revenue ($90M) + private bonds ($5M from allies)

**Goal:** 100 units by 2027 (permanent affordable LGBTQ housing)

### January 2026: Mamdani North Townhall

**Invite:** Mamdani (NYC), Kshama Sawant (Seattle), COPE (Vancouver)

**Topic:** "How Electoral Wins Fund Co-ops"

**Ask:** NDP to redirect SVT → UCI co-op fund ($10M/year)

### March 2026: Vancity Equity Sale Campaign

**Target:** 500K members vote to convert Vancity to full worker co-op

**Mechanism:** 2% equity sale annually (Colorado law model)

**Result:** 100K worker-owners by 2030

## Conclusion: Ownership > Identity

Align with: Anyone under $1M who builds co-ops  
Reject: Anyone over $1M who blocks ownership  
Win by: Owning the future together

In Vancouver, November 14, 2025:

Host the **99% Ownership Summit** — Jews, Muslims, Christians, LGBTQ, socialists, small capitalists — all at one table.

Agenda:
- $100M bank boycott
- 5 new CLTs
- 10 worker co-ops

**The 1% don't care about your identity. Neither should we.**

#99ResetVan | Ownership > Identity

## For Organizers: Talking Points

**When recruiting allies:**
- "Do you own your workplace? No? Then you're one of us."
- "Your mosque/synagogue/church has co-op roots. Let's revive them."
- "Pride isn't just about rights—it's about owning our community."

**When rejecting opponents:**
- "You have $5M? Great. Sell $4M to the wealth fund or you're the enemy."
- "You want state control? We tried that in the USSR. It failed. Co-ops work."
- "You fund Democrats but block unions? You're on the wrong side."

**The unifying frame:**
"In 20 years, either billionaires own everything, or we do. Pick a side."
