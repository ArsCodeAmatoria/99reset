## Executive Summary

On November 4, 2025, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City on a democratic socialist platform that raised $4 billion/year through targeted taxes on the ultra-rich to fund public alternatives—universal childcare, fare-free transit, rent freezes, and city-owned groceries. The 99% Reset, by contrast, is a global, non-electoral, phased movement (2025–2045) that uses mass withdrawal of consent—bank boycotts, union drives, worker co-ops, CLTs, and wealth funds—to make the 1% economically irrelevant without relying on state capture.

This paper compares the two models across six dimensions: speed, scale, risk, dependency, ownership, and endgame. Mamdani's strategy is electoral turbo (12–24 months to policy wins); the Reset is institutional tectonic (2–20 years to structural shift). Both aim to decommodify essentials and redistribute capital, but Mamdani uses top-down taxation + public provision, while the Reset uses bottom-up divestment + parallel ownership. The verdict: Mamdani accelerates Phase 1–2 of the Reset; the Reset survives Phase 3 when Mamdani's wins are reversed by courts or federal overreach.

## 1. Speed & Sequencing

| Dimension | Mamdani (NYC) | 99% Reset (Global) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timeline | 12–24 months to revenue + programs | Phase 1: 2–4 yrs (boycotts), Phase 2: 4–8 yrs (co-ops/CLTs), Phase 3: 8–20 yrs (wealth fund) |
| First Win | Jan 2026: $4B budget line items | Dec 2025: $10B bank boycott → OSFI probe |
| Scaling | NYC budget ($118B) → state/federal pressure | Local (Vancouver) → national (Canada) → global |
| Reversal Risk | High (state veto, Trump cuts) | Low (parallel systems survive policy rollback) |

**Verdict:** Mamdani front-loads impact; Reset back-loads permanence.

## 2. Revenue & Redistribution Mechanism

| Mechanism | Mamdani | 99% Reset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tax Base | 2% surcharge &gt;$1M + 11.5% corp &gt;$5M | 1% wealth tax &gt;$10M + 2–3% TSX transaction tax + SVT/land-value tax |
| Yield | $4B/year (NYC) | $30B/year (Canada) → $2–4K dividend/citizen |
| Flow | State → public programs (childcare, buses) | State → Citizens' Wealth Fund → universal dividend |
| Anti-Welfare Lock | Universal but state-administered | Equity-locked (dividends only to shareholders) |

**Mamdani taxes income; Reset taxes capital.**

**Mamdani funds services; Reset funds ownership.**

## 3. Decommodification Strategy

| Essential | Mamdani (Public Provision) | 99% Reset (Parallel Ownership) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Housing | Rent freeze + Social Housing Agency (state-built) | CLTs (community-owned land, perpetual affordability) |
| Food | City-owned groceries (municipal stores) | Worker co-op markets (employee-owned, reader-funded) |
| Transit | Fare-free buses (public subsidy) | Transit co-ops (rider-owned, fare revenue reinvested) |
| Media | N/A | Media co-ops (subscriber-owned, no state funding) |

**Mamdani builds public monopolies; Reset builds democratic monopolies.**

## 4. Risk & Resilience

| Risk | Mamdani | 99% Reset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State Capture | High (Hochul veto, Trump cuts) | Low (no state needed for co-ops/CLTs) |
| Billionaire Flight | Medium (tax exile to FL/CT) | High but irrelevant (wealth fund buys fleeing shares) |
| Court Reversal | High (NY courts struck down congestion pricing 2024) | Low (CLTs/co-ops are private contracts) |
| Federal Override | High (Trump threatens $7.4B cut) | Medium (CRA audits survive federal change) |

**Mamdani wins fast, loses fast. Reset wins slow, loses never.**

## 5. Ownership vs. Access

| Outcome | Mamdani | 99% Reset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who Owns? | The State (public agencies) | The 99% (co-op members, CLT residents, fund shareholders) |
| Power Source | Elected officials (4-year cycles) | Irrevocable trusts (perpetual, democratic) |
| Exit Ramp | Next election (2029) | None (equity vests over 5–7 years) |

**Mamdani gives access; Reset gives equity.**

## 6. Endgame: Billionaire Irrelevance

| 2040 Vision | Mamdani Path | 99% Reset Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top 1% Wealth Share | 15–18% (tax drag) | &lt;10% (fund owns 40% of market) |
| Billionaire Role | Taxed minority (still own firms) | Minority shareholders (fund votes shares) |
| Working Class Asset | Public services | $2–4K annual dividend + co-op equity |
| Reversal Proof | No (next mayor repeals) | Yes (trusts can't be unwound) |

**Mamdani shrinks the pie. Reset redistributes the bakery.**

## Strategic Synthesis: How Mamdani Accelerates the 99% Reset

| Reset Phase | Mamdani Boost |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 1 (Starve) | His $4B tax win = proof-of-concept for wealth tax petitions |
| Phase 2 (Flood) | City groceries = pilot for worker co-op markets |
| Phase 3 (Reset) | Rent freeze = bridge to CLT permanence |

**Use Mamdani as a battering ram, then build the fortress.**

## Conclusion: Two Lanes, One Destination

| Model | Best For | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mamdani | Cities with progressive majorities (NYC, Vancouver, Toronto) | Reversible by courts/elections |
| 99% Reset | Long-term structural change (global, any polity) | Slower, needs mass discipline |

### The Optimal Path:

**2025–2027:** Run Mamdani-style candidates in Vancouver (COPE), Toronto, Montreal to force tax wins.

**2027–2035:** Lock revenue into CLTs, co-ops, and wealth funds (Reset Phase 2–3).

**2035+:** Billionaires become museum pieces—not because they're taxed, but because the 99% own the future.

**Mamdani lights the match. The 99% Reset builds the fire that never goes out.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Electoral socialism (Mamdani) delivers quick wins but requires constant defense.** One election loss undoes rent freezes, fare-free transit, and municipal groceries.

2. **Institutional ownership (Reset) takes decades but becomes irreversible.** CLTs legally prevent resale to speculators; co-ops vest equity over years; wealth funds operate like Alaska's Permanent Fund (48 years strong).

3. **Complementary, not competing.** Vancouver's COPE could run a Mamdani-style mayor in 2026, tax billionaires $500M/year, then redirect that revenue to UCI co-ops and CHF BC CLTs. By 2035, the programs survive even if a conservative mayor wins.

4. **The Reset is Mamdani-proof and Trump-proof.** Federal governments can't dissolve worker co-ops or seize CLT land (private contracts). Courts can't overturn parallel institutions. The 1% becomes irrelevant not via policy, but via **withdrawal of our labor, deposits, and consent.**

## For Organizers

**If you're in NYC, Vancouver, Toronto, or Montreal:**
- Support Mamdani-style candidates (COPE, NDP, DSA) for 2026-2028 elections
- Push them to fund co-ops/CLTs, not just public programs
- Build Reset infrastructure (unions, credit unions, CLTs) **while** they're in office
- When they lose (and they will), your institutions survive

**If you're anywhere else:**
- Don't wait for elections—start Phase 1 today (bank switch, union drive)
- Mamdani proves wealth taxes are viable—cite him in petitions to your city/province
- Build parallel ownership so you're **independent** of whoever wins in 2029

**Two lanes, one destination: The 1% becomes economically irrelevant by 2045.**
