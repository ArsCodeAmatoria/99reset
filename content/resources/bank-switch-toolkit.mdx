## Why Switch?

Canada's Big 5 banks (RBC, TD, BMO, Scotiabank, CIBC) financed **$900 billion** in fossil fuels since 2016 and enable billionaire wealth concentration through offshore havens. Your deposits fund this. Credit unions, by contrast:

- **Member-owned:** One-member-one-vote governance
- **Community-focused:** Loans stay local (mortgages, small business)
- **Lower fees:** Non-profit structure passes savings to members
- **Divested:** Most have fossil-free portfolios

Moving $50 billion in deposits (just 1% of Big 5's base) crashes their credit ratings **3x faster** than regulation, forcing divestment from speculative assets.

## 30-Day Switch Plan

### Week 1: Research & Choose

1. **Find Your Credit Union:**
   - Use [Credit Union Central of Canada's locator](https://www.cucentral.ca)
   - Compare: Fees, ATM networks, online banking, fossil-free policies
   - Top picks: Vancity (BC), Alterna (ON), Desjardins (QC)

2. **Check Eligibility:**
   - Most credit unions require you live/work in their region
   - Join with a $5-25 membership share (you become an owner!)

3. **Open New Accounts:**
   - Chequing + Savings (mirror your current setup)
   - Request debit card, online access, cheques

### Week 2: Redirect Income

4. **Update Direct Deposits:**
   - Employer payroll: Provide new void cheque
   - Government benefits (CPP, EI): Update via My Service Canada
   - Other income sources (pension, investments)

5. **Run Dual Accounts:**
   - Keep old bank open temporarily to catch stragglers
   - Verify 2-3 payroll cycles hit new account

### Week 3: Move Bill Payments

6. **Transfer Pre-Authorized Payments:**
   - List all automatic payments (utilities, rent, subscriptions)
   - Update each with new account details
   - Set reminders for first billing cycles to confirm

7. **Migrate Investments:**
   - Transfer RRSPs/TFSAs (contact new credit union's advisor)
   - Avoid withdrawal penalties by direct transfer

### Week 4: Close Old Bank

8. **Final Steps:**
   - Confirm zero pending transactions
   - Withdraw/transfer remaining balance
   - Close accounts in-person or by phone
   - Request written confirmation

9. **Celebrate & Recruit:**
   - Tell 5 friends: "I switched to [Credit Union]. Big 5 banks fund fossil fuels with our money."

## Conversation Scripts

### At Work (Break Room)

> **You:** "Hey, did you know our bank financed $180 billion in oil since 2016? I just switched to [Credit Union]—same online banking, but my money stays local. Takes like 3 weeks. Want the link?"

### At Family Dinner

> **You:** "Mom, Dad—I moved to [Credit Union]. Remember when the Big 5 got bailed out in 2008? Credit unions didn't need that because they don't gamble with deposits. Plus, lower fees. You should check them out."

### Online Post

> "Just completed my #BankSwitch to [Credit Union]! 🎉 No more funding fossil fuels with my savings. Took 4 weeks, saved $15/month in fees, and now I'm a co-owner. If 1% of Canadians do this, we crash Big 5 credit ratings. Who's next? #99Reset"

## FAQs

**Q: Will I lose access to ATMs?**  
A: Most credit unions use Exchange/Interac networks (7,000+ ATMs). Some partner with Credit Union Central for surcharge-free access.

**Q: Is my money safe?**  
A: Yes. Credit unions are insured by provincial deposit insurance (e.g., DICO in Ontario, CUDIC in BC) up to $100K, same as CDIC for banks.

**Q: Can I still pay bills online?**  
A: Absolutely. Credit unions offer the same Interac bill payment system as Big 5.

**Q: What if I need a mortgage?**  
A: Credit unions often have **better rates** (0.1-0.3% lower) because they're non-profit. They also approve more local borrowers.

**Q: Will my employer accept credit union direct deposit?**  
A: Yes. Provide a void cheque or direct deposit form—it's identical to bank setup.

## Impact Projections

If **100,000 Canadians** switch $10,000 each:

- **$1 billion** moved to credit unions
- **50-100** local mortgages/small business loans funded
- **Big 5 rating downgrade** if trend accelerates (Moody's threshold: 5% deposit loss)
- **$1.5 million** in fees redirected to communities (at $15/person/month)

Historical precedent: 2017 #DeleteFacebook moved 10M users; banks are more vulnerable because ratings determine loan costs.
