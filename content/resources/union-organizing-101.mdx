## Why Unionize?

Unions shift bargaining power from owners to workers. In Canada:

- **Union wage premium:** +$5.40/hour average (StatsCan 2024)
- **Benefits:** 85% have pensions vs. 35% non-union
- **Job security:** Collective agreements prevent arbitrary firing
- **Democracy:** Workers vote on contracts, elect leaders

**The Reset Connection:** Unions are Phase 1 infrastructure. A 10% unionization increase redirects **$50 billion** from profits to wages (OECD model), starving speculative bubbles and funding co-op transitions.

## Legal Rights (Canada)

### Federal Jurisdiction (10% of workers)
- **Industries:** Banking, telecoms, federal public service, interprovincial transport
- **Card-Check:** Sign 40% of workers → Labour Board orders vote; 50%+1 wins
- **Protected Activities:** Organizing, discussing unions, distributing materials (on breaks/off-site)

### Provincial Jurisdiction (90% of workers)
Varies by province:

| Province | Card-Check Threshold | Vote Required? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BC** | 55% → auto-certification | No vote if &gt;55% |
| **Ontario** | 40% → triggers vote | Yes (50%+1 to win) |
| **Québec** | 50% → auto-certification | No vote if &gt;50% |
| **Alberta** | 40% → triggers vote | Yes |

**Your Rights:**
- Discuss unions during breaks/lunch
- Distribute materials outside work hours
- Protection from retaliation (firing, demotion)

**Employer CAN'T:**
- Threaten to close/relocate
- Spy on organizing meetings
- Fire/discipline for union activity
- Promise raises to stop organizing

## 90-Day Organizing Campaign

### Phase 1: Build Your Organizing Committee (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Identify Leaders:**
   - Look for respected, long-term employees across departments
   - Aim for 5-10% of workforce (e.g., 5-10 leaders for 100 workers)
   - Diversity matters: Different shifts, demographics, roles

2. **Secret First Meeting:**
   - Off-site (someone's home, café, park)
   - Discuss: Why unionize? Top 3 workplace issues?
   - Commit to confidentiality until 30% signed

3. **Contact a Union:**
   - Choose sector-specific unions:
     - **Unifor:** Auto, retail, media (unifor.org)
     - **UFCW:** Grocery, food service (ufcw.ca)
     - **CUPE:** Public sector (cupe.ca)
     - **United Steelworkers:** Manufacturing (usw.ca)
   - Unions provide: Legal support, training, card templates

### Phase 2: Card Campaign (Weeks 3-8)

4. **Map the Workplace:**
   - List all employees (names, shifts, departments)
   - Mark: Supporters (green), undecided (yellow), opponents (red)
   - Focus on green/yellow first

5. **One-on-One Conversations:**
   - **The Ask:** "Would you sign a card to vote on whether we want a union?"
   - **Listen:** What's their top issue? (Wages, safety, respect?)
   - **Connect:** "A union gives us a voice to fix [their issue]. The card just gets us a vote."
   - **Sign:** Use union-provided cards (name, signature, date)

6. **Track Progress:**
   - Update your map daily
   - Hit **60%** to be safe (accounts for employer pressure)

### Phase 3: File for Certification (Week 9)

7. **Submit Cards:**
   - Union files with Labour Board (federal) or provincial agency
   - **Timeline:** Board orders vote within 5-10 days (or auto-certifies if &gt;55% in BC/QC)

8. **Employer Gets Notice:**
   - Expect captive-audience meetings, anti-union consultants
   - Stay calm: "We just want a fair vote."

### Phase 4: Win the Vote (Weeks 10-12)

9. **Counter Employer Tactics:**
   - **"We're a family"** → "Families don't fire you for being sick."
   - **"Unions are outsiders"** → "We ARE the union. Leaders are elected by us."
   - **"You'll lose flexibility"** → "Flexibility = unpaid overtime. Contracts protect us."

10. **Get-Out-the-Vote:**
   - Remind supporters to vote (day/time/location)
   - Offer rides if needed
   - Vote is secret ballot—no one knows who voted how

11. **Victory (50%+1):**
   - Union certified! Now bargain first contract (6-12 months)

## Employer Union-Busting Tactics (And How to Counter)

| Tactic | Counter-Message |
| --- | --- |
| **"Unions cost you dues!"** | "Dues average $50/month. Union wage premium is $900/month. We net $850." |
| **"We'll close/relocate."** | "Illegal threat under Labour Code. Report to Board." |
| **Captive-audience meetings** | "They're scared. If unions were bad, why spend $10K on consultants?" |
| **Sudden raises/benefits** | "Why only now? Because we're organizing. Imagine what we get WITH a contract." |
| **"Union can't guarantee anything."** | "True—but WE vote on the contract. No deal unless we approve." |

## Sample Organizing Script

### Opening
> **You:** "Hey [Name], got a minute? I wanted your take on something."

### Problem
> **You:** "You ever feel like [specific issue: wages, scheduling, safety]? Like, we work hard, but [Owner/Manager] makes all the calls."

### Solution
> **You:** "Some of us are talking to [Union Name] about organizing. It'd give us a real voice—we'd negotiate a contract, vote on it. If it sucks, we vote no."

### The Ask
> **You:** "Would you sign a card to get us a vote? It's confidential—just you, me, and the union. Takes 30 seconds."

### Objections
- **"I don't want to cause trouble."**  
  *"I get it. But asking for fairness isn't trouble. It's legal, and we can't get fired for it."*

- **"What if we lose?"**  
  *"Then we tried. But if we don't try, nothing changes. We've got 60% already."*

## Success Stories

- **Starbucks Canada (2020-2025):** 400+ stores unionized via Workers United; won $2/hour raises, guaranteed hours.
- **Amazon YYZ1 (2024):** Teamsters certified after 18-month campaign; first contract included safety protocols, 15% wage increase.
- **Loblaw Warehouses (2022-2024):** Unifor organized 12 sites; contracts added pensions, ended forced overtime.

---

## After Certification: Bargaining Your First Contract

1. **Elect Bargaining Committee:** 3-5 workers + union rep
2. **Survey Members:** Top 5 priorities? (Wages, benefits, seniority, grievance process)
3. **Negotiate:** 6-18 months; employer must bargain "in good faith"
4. **Strike Leverage:** 72% of first contracts settle without strikes; if needed, vote to authorize
5. **Ratify:** Members vote yes/no on final contract (need 50%+1)

**Typical First Contract Wins:**
- **Wages:** 10-20% over 3 years
- **Benefits:** Dental, pension, paid sick days
- **Job Security:** "Just cause" for firing (no arbitrary termination)
- **Grievance Process:** Written procedure to challenge violations

---

## Red Flags (When to Pause)

- **Under 30% Support:** Wait; filing prematurely tips off employer
- **High Turnover Workplace:** Build stability first (hard to organize revolving door)
- **Single Agitator:** Need a committee, not a lone hero (targets get fired)

## FAQs

**Q: Can I get fired for organizing?**  
A: No—it's illegal. If it happens, file unfair labour practice charge; Labour Board can order reinstatement + back pay.

**Q: How long does organizing take?**  
A: 3-6 months for card campaign + vote; 6-12 months to bargain first contract.

**Q: Do we pay dues before certification?**  
A: No. Dues start AFTER first contract is ratified (usually 1-2% of gross pay).

**Q: What if my coworkers say no?**  
A: Respect it. Focus on undecided workers. Some need to see majority support before committing.

**Q: Can part-timers join?**  
A: Yes! Part-timers are often the most exploited and benefit most from contracts.
