## Why Policy Matters

Grassroots action (bank switches, unions, co-ops) builds power, but **policy locks in gains**. Without legislation:
- Big 5 banks can block credit union growth via regulatory capture
- Unions face anti-labour laws (Alberta's Bill 32 weakened card-check)
- Co-ops lack financing (no federal equivalent to US SBA loans)

**Reset Phase 2-3:** Policy advocacy scales victories. A **1% wealth tax** on assets &gt;$10M generates **$5.6 billion/year** (PBO 2025)—funding CLTs, co-ops, and citizens' dividends.

## Three-Level Strategy

### Municipal (Easiest Wins)
**Timeline:** 6-18 months  
**Targets:** Progressive councils (Vancouver, Toronto, Montréal)  
**Asks:**
- **Vacancy taxes** (500% on empty homes/commercial) → Fund CLTs
- **CLT land donations** (surplus city lots)
- **Living wage ordinances** ($25/hour for city contractors)
- **Co-op zoning preferences** (fast-track permits)

### Provincial (Medium Difficulty)
**Timeline:** 1-3 years  
**Targets:** NDP/Green governments (BC, QC potential)  
**Asks:**
- **Speculation taxes** (expand BC's SVT to AB, ON)
- **Card-check unionization** (auto-certify at 55%)
- **Worker co-op incentives** (tax credits, grants)
- **Wealth taxes** (1-2% on &gt;$10M assets)

### Federal (Hardest, Highest Impact)
**Timeline:** 3-5 years  
**Targets:** NDP (if minority government leverage)  
**Asks:**
- **Capital gains reform** (66.7% inclusion → 100%)
- **Offshore haven crackdown** (close loopholes costing $3.65B/year)
- **Co-op Development Bank** ($1B fund for worker co-ops)
- **Citizens' Wealth Fund** (2-3% TSX transaction tax)

## Campaign Roadmap (12 Months)

### Months 1-3: Research & Coalition

1. **Pick Your Target Policy:**
   - Choose ONE specific ask (don't dilute focus)
   - Criteria: High impact, winnable, aligned with local appetite
   - Example: BC vacancy tax expansion to Alberta

2. **Research:**
   - **Precedents:** What jurisdictions passed similar laws? (e.g., BC SVT 2018)
   - **Costing:** How much revenue/impact? (Use PBO, C4TF reports)
   - **Opposition:** Who will fight this? (Real estate lobby, chambers of commerce)

3. **Build Coalition:**
   - **Core:** 99% Reset chapter, union locals, tenant unions
   - **Allies:** Churches, environmental groups, student unions
   - **Credibility:** Economists, lawyers, academics (for testimony)
   - **Goal:** 20+ orgs signed on to platform

### Months 4-6: Public Education

4. **Messaging:**
   - **Problem:** "Alberta has 15,000 vacant homes while 4,000 are homeless."
   - **Solution:** "A 500% vacancy tax raises $50M/year for affordable housing—like BC's SVT."
   - **Moral:** "Hoarding homes for profit while families sleep in cars is wrong."

5. **Tools:**
   - **One-pager:** PDF with stats, precedent, ask (template below)
   - **Social media:** Infographics, videos (30-60 sec), testimonials
   - **Op-eds:** Submit to local papers (Edmonton Journal, Calgary Herald)
   - **Town halls:** Host 3-5 public meetings (union halls, libraries)

6. **Petition:**
   - Goal: 10,000+ signatures (shows public support)
   - Platforms: [Change.org](https://change.org), [LeadNow](https://leadnow.ca)

### Months 7-9: Direct Lobbying

7. **Target Decision-Makers:**
   - **Municipal:** City councillors (focus on swing votes)
   - **Provincial:** MLAs (target NDP, Green; pressure centrist Liberals)
   - **Federal:** MPs (NDP caucus, vulnerable Liberals)

8. **Lobby Tactics:**
   - **Meetings:** Book 30-min slots (bring 3-5 constituents + expert)
   - **Script:** "I'm a voter in [Riding]. [Problem] affects my family. [Solution] works in BC. Will you support this?"
   - **Leave-behind:** One-pager, petition signatures, coalition letters

9. **Committee Testimony:**
   - **When:** Bill goes to committee (public hearings)
   - **Who:** Coalition spokesperson (5-min testimony)
   - **Content:** Problem, solution, answer opposition's concerns

### Months 10-12: Mobilization & Vote

10. **Escalate Pressure:**
    - **Rallies:** 500+ people at city hall/legislature
    - **Media:** Press releases, interviews (amplify petition numbers)
    - **Inside game:** Allies on council/legislature introduce motion

11. **Vote:**
    - **Track:** Who's yes/no/undecided (call undecided daily)
    - **Turnout:** Pack gallery (shows public is watching)
    - **Win or Lose:** If pass → celebrate; if fail → target elections

12. **Enforcement (If Win):**
    - Monitor implementation (governments often delay)
    - Sue if necessary (CCLA, tenant unions have legal resources)

## Lobby Meeting Script

**Intro (30 seconds):**
> "Hi, I'm [Name], a constituent in [Riding]. I work at [Job], and I'm here with [2-3 others] from [Coalition]. Thanks for meeting us."

**Problem (1 minute):**
> "Housing costs in [City] have risen 350% since 1979, while wages are flat. My family pays 60% of income on rent. Meanwhile, [X,000] homes sit vacant—hoarded by speculators like [Billionaire Name]. This is unsustainable."

**Solution (1 minute):**
> "We're asking you to support a [Policy Name]. It worked in [Precedent Jurisdiction]: They raised [$X million], funded [Y units] of affordable housing, and didn't hurt the economy. Here's a one-pager with the details."

**Ask (30 seconds):**
> "Will you vote yes on this? If not, what concerns do you have?"

**Listen & Respond (2-3 minutes):**
- **"It'll hurt the economy."** → "BC's SVT didn't—GDP grew 3% during rollout. Speculators leaving frees up housing."
- **"We need more study."** → "Fair. Will you commit to a vote within [X months] after review?"
- **"I can't promise."** → "Understood. Can we follow up in [2 weeks]? We have 10,000 petition signatures."

**Close (30 seconds):**
> "Thanks for your time. We'll check in [date]. Here's my contact if you have questions."

## Coalition-Building Tips

### Who to Recruit
- **Labour:** Unions have money, members, political clout (CUPE, Unifor, UFCW)
- **Faith:** Churches/mosques have moral authority (e.g., Kairos, Islamic Relief)
- **Students:** Campus groups mobilize fast (Canadian Federation of Students)
- **Tenants:** Directly affected (ACORN, Vancouver Tenants Union)
- **Climate:** Overlap on fossil finance (350.org, Council of Canadians)

### What to Offer
- **Shared platform:** Co-brand materials (your logo + theirs)
- **Division of labour:** Unions mobilize turnout; students do social media; faith groups host events
- **Credit:** If win, everyone claims victory (builds future cooperation)

### Red Flags
- **Foundations with strings:** Some won't support "radical" policies (e.g., wealth taxes)
- **Partisan capture:** Keep non-partisan (endorse policy, not parties)
- **Mission creep:** Focus on ONE ask per campaign

## Opposition Tactics (And Counters)

| Opposition Claim | Counter |
| --- | --- |
| **"Wealth taxes cause capital flight."** | "BC's SVT didn't—revenue up 300%. If billionaires leave, good—less speculation." |
| **"This hurts small businesses."** | "Exemption threshold is $10M. Average business is $500K. This targets ultra-rich only." |
| **"Government will waste the money."** | "Revenue goes to CLTs (transparent, community-governed). Not general fund." |
| **"This is class warfare."** | "No—it's rebalancing. Top 1% own 25% of wealth. Middle class owned 50% in 1980. We're restoring that." |
| **"Unions are corrupt."** | "Some bad actors exist everywhere. 5M Canadian workers choose unions—democracy in action." |

## Success Metrics

| Policy Win | Timeline | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Municipal vacancy tax** | 12-18 months | $10-50M/year revenue; 500-2,000 vacant units freed |

| **Provincial card-check** | 1-2 years | 100K+ new union members over 5 years |
| **Federal co-op bank** | 3-5 years | 1,000 new worker co-ops by 2030 |

## FAQs

**Q: Should we target right-wing governments?**  
A: Only if issue has bipartisan support (e.g., child poverty). Otherwise, focus on swing districts or wait for elections.

**Q: How do we counter industry lobby groups?**  
A: Outnumber them with grassroots (they have money; you have people). Fill committee rooms, flood phone lines.

**Q: What if we lose the vote?**  
A: Target elections. Defeat opponents; elect champions. Losing a vote educates the public and builds momentum.

**Q: Do we need lawyers?**  
A: For drafting bills, yes (pro bono via law school clinics or union lawyers). For lobbying, no.
