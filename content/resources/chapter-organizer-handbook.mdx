## What is a 99% Reset Chapter?

A **chapter** is a local node of the global movement—10-1000 members executing Phase 1-3 tactics in their city/region. Chapters are:

- **Autonomous:** You choose priorities (bank switches, union drives, CLTs)
- **Democratic:** One member, one vote on strategy
- **Networked:** Share toolkits, coordinate national campaigns
- **Action-oriented:** Not a book club—you build power

**Why Chapters?**
- **Scale:** 100 chapters with 100 members each = 10,000 activists → tipping point for policy wins
- **Resilience:** Decentralized (no single point of failure)
- **Legitimacy:** Elected leaders,transparent finances → credibility with media/politicians

## Growing from 10 to 100 Members

### Recruitment Tactics
1. **Events:** Host monthly public events (film screenings, speakers, panels)

   - **Turnout:** 30-50 people; convert 10% to members (3-5 new)

2. **Tabling:** Set up at farmers markets, university campuses, union rallies
   - **Materials:** Flyers, sign-up sheet, QR code to Signal group
   - **Pitch:** "We're organizing to tax billionaires and build co-ops. Want in?"

3. **Partnerships:** Co-host with aligned orgs (unions, tenant unions, climate groups)
   - **Example:** Joint protest against RBC fossil financing → recruit their members

4. **Digital:** Social media contests (tag 3 friends), local influencer shout-outs

### Onboarding
- **Welcome email:** Within 24 hours (intro, next meeting, how to help)
- **Buddy system:** Pair newbies with veterans (coffee chat, answer questions)
- **Quick win:** Give new members easy task (e.g., "Can you post this on Instagram?")

---

## Campaign Planning (90-Day Cycle)

### Month 1: Research & Strategy
- **Working group:** 5-8 people research issue (e.g., bank switch feasibility)
- **Deliverable:** Campaign plan (goal, tactics, timeline, resources needed)
- **Vote:** Present to general meeting; 66% approval to proceed

### Month 2: Execution
- **Weekly actions:** Tabling, lobby meetings, social media blitz
- **Track metrics:** Sign-ups, media hits, petition signatures
- **Adapt:** If tactic fails (e.g., turnout low), pivot quickly

### Month 3: Wrap-Up & Celebrate
- **Win or learn:** If goal hit (e.g., 50 bank switchers), celebrate publicly; if not, debrief what went wrong
- **Media:** Press release, photos, testimonials
- **Rest:** Take 2-week break before next campaign

## Working Group Structure

Chapters scale via **working groups** (5-15 people focused on one domain):

| Working Group | Focus | Example Projects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Finance** | Bank boycotts, credit unions, wealth taxes | Bank switch drives, municipal vacancy tax campaign |
| **Labour** | Union organizing, strikes, worker co-ops | Support local union drives, co-op feasibility studies |
| **Housing** | CLTs, tenant organizing, speculation taxes | Launch CLT, lobby for vacancy tax |
| **Policy** | Lobbying, legislation, coalitions | Draft bylaw, testify at city council |
| **Communications** | Social media, press, design | Run Instagram, write press releases, design flyers |

**Coordination:** Working groups report to general meeting monthly; steering committee ensures alignment.

---

## Governance Models

### Informal (10-25 members)
- **Meetings:** Weekly, rotating facilitator
- **Decisions:** Consensus or majority vote
- **Pros:** Fast, flexible
- **Cons:** Can be cliquey; personality conflicts

### Steering Committee (25-100 members)
- **Structure:** 5-7 elected leaders (6-month terms); general meeting votes on major decisions
- **Roles:** Coordinator, treasurer, communications lead, campaign leads (x2-3)
- **Meetings:** Steering meets weekly; general meets monthly
- **Pros:** Scalable, accountable
- **Cons:** Can become top-down if leaders don't listen

### Board of Directors (100+ members)
- **Structure:** 7-11 elected board (1-year terms); staff handle operations
- **Roles:** Board sets strategy; ED (paid) executes
- **Meetings:** Board monthly; general quarterly
- **Pros:** Professional, sustainable
- **Cons:** Can lose grassroots feel

**Best practice:** Start informal → steering at 25 members → board at 100.

## Coalition-Building

- **Faith:** Kairos, Islamic Relief
- **Student:** Canadian Federation of Students

**How to collaborate:**
- **Co-host events:** Split costs, cross-promote
- **Shared campaigns:** E.g., joint lobby day for vacancy tax
- **Avoid:** Turf wars (credit should be shared); mission drift (stay focused)

---

## Conflict Resolution

**Common conflicts:**
1. **Personality clashes:** Mediate privately (steering committee); if unresolved, suggest one person step back
2. **Strategic disagreements:** Vote (66% majority for major decisions); minority can dissent but must respect outcome
3. **Burnout:** Enforce term limits (no one stays in leadership >2 years); redistribute tasks

**Red flags for toxicity:**
- One person dominates every meeting
- Decisions made outside meetings (cliques)
- Retaliation for dissent

**Fix:** Address immediately (steering committee); if unresolved, remove toxic member (66% vote).

## FAQs

**Q: How much time does organizing take?**  
A: Launch phase: 5-10 hours/week. Growth: 10-20 hours/week. If you have a job, share leadership (co-coordinators).

**Q: What if no one shows up to first meeting?**  
A: Reschedule; personally invite 10 people (1-on-1 is more effective than mass invite).

**Q: How do we handle infiltrators/trolls?**  
A: Membership approval process (steering committee votes on new members); code of conduct (ban harassment).

**Q: Should we incorporate as nonprofit?**  
A: Not until 100+ members (legal/tax overhead). Before that, fiscal sponsor via allied nonprofit.
