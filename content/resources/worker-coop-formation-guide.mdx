## What is a Worker Co-op?

A **worker cooperative** is a business owned and democratically controlled by its employees. Key principles:

- **One member, one vote:** Not one share, one vote
- **Profit-sharing:** Distributed based on hours worked or patronage
- **Member ownership:** Workers own equity, not external shareholders

**Why Co-ops?**
- **Resilience:** 3x survival rate vs. conventional startups (Québec data)
- **Equity:** Average wage gap (highest/lowest) is 3:1 vs. 300:1 in corporations
- **Community wealth:** Profits stay local, not extracted to distant shareholders

**Reset Phase 2:** Co-ops are the ownership infrastructure. Scaling to 2,000 by year 10 redirects **$5-10 billion** from speculation to worker wealth.

## 12-Month Formation Timeline

2. **Choose Your Sector:**
   - **High-potential:** Tech, retail, food service, care work, skilled trades
   - **Research:** Market size, competition, customer base

3. **Feasibility Study:**
   - **Revenue model:** How will you make money?
   - **Startup costs:** Equipment, rent, inventory ($10K-$100K typical)
   - **Breakeven:** Month when revenue &gt; expenses
   - Use [CWCF's feasibility template](https://canadianworker.coop)

4. **Governance Structure:**
   - **Board:** Elected by members (3-9 people); 1-year terms
   - **Committees:** Finance, membership, operations
   - **Decision-making:** Consensus for major votes; majority for routine

     - **Québec:** Régional solidarity co-ops (RLS) provide $10K-$100K loans
     - **Credit unions:** Vancity, Desjardins offer co-op-specific loans (5-7% interest)

   - Consider co-working spaces or shared facilities initially

9. **Hire/Recruit Members:**
   - **Member-workers:** Employed + own equity (probationary period: 6-12 months before full membership)
   - **Non-member workers:** Temporary or specialized roles (max 25% of workforce per co-op best practices)

10. **Systems & Tools:**
    - **Accounting:** QuickBooks, Wave (free for small co-ops)

## Governance Models

### Consensus-Based (Best for &lt;10 members)
- All major decisions require unanimous consent
- **Pros:** Inclusive, builds trust
- **Cons:** Slow; one person can block progress

### Majority Vote (Best for 10-50 members)
- 50%+1 for routine decisions; 66% for bylaws, dissolution
- **Pros:** Faster; democratic
- **Cons:** Can marginalize minority views

### Delegated (Best for &gt;50 members)
- Board handles day-to-day; members vote on annual budget, board elections
- **Pros:** Scalable
- **Cons:** Requires strong accountability mechanisms

---

## Profit Distribution

### Patronage Model (Most Common)
- Surplus (profit) divided based on hours worked or seniority
- Example: $100K surplus, 10 members, 20,000 hours total → $5/hour bonus

### Equal Distribution
- Each member gets equal share
- **Pros:** Simple, egalitarian
- **Cons:** Doesn't reward high performers; can demotivate

### Hybrid
- 50% equal, 50% patronage
- Balances equity and merit

**Tax Advantage:** In Canada, co-ops can deduct patronage dividends as expenses (lowers corporate tax).

## Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid)

| Pitfall | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **"Founder syndrome"** (one person dominates) | Rotate chair role; enforce term limits |
| **Unclear roles** (everyone does everything) | Write job descriptions; assign portfolios |
| **Undercapitalization** (run out of money) | Raise 2x what you think you need; have 6-month reserve |
| **Free-riding** (some members slack) | Probationary period; performance reviews |
| **Burnout** (co-ops overwork themselves) | Set max hours (35-40/week); track workload |

## FAQs

**Q: Can I convert an existing business to a co-op?**  
A: Yes! Succession co-ops are common (retiring owner sells to employees). Use [Project Equity's toolkit](https://project-equity.org).

**Q: How do I fire a member?**  
A: Bylaws should include termination clause (e.g., 66% vote after warning). Legal advice required.

**Q: What if members disagree on major decisions?**  
A: Mediation first (CWCF offers services). If irreconcilable, dissolution clause in bylaws.

**Q: Can co-ops scale?**  
A: Yes. Mondragon (Spain) has 80,000 worker-owners; Québec has 200-person co-ops. Requires strong governance.

**Q: Do co-ops pay taxes?**  
A: Yes—corporate tax (lower rate for small biz); members pay income tax on wages/dividends.
