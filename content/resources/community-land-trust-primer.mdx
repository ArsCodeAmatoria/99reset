## What is a Community Land Trust?

A **Community Land Trust (CLT)** is a nonprofit corporation that owns land and leases it to residents, ensuring **permanent affordability**. Key features:

- **Land stays in trust:** Never resold at market price
- **Leaseholds:** Residents own buildings (99-year leases), not land
- **Resale formula:** Limits profit on home resale (e.g., 25% of appreciation)
- **Community governance:** 1/3 residents, 1/3 community, 1/3 public reps

**Why CLTs?**
- **Anti-speculation:** Removes land from market, preventing bubbles (+350% since 1979 in Canada)
- **Generational wealth:** Builds modest equity while keeping housing affordable
- **Community control:** Locals decide land use, not distant investors

**Reset Phase 2:** CLTs are the housing infrastructure. Scaling to 50,000 units by year 10 redirects **$15-20 billion** from landlords/speculators to permanent community assets.

## How CLTs Work

### Traditional Homeownership
1. Buy land + house at market price ($800K in Vancouver)
2. Hope for appreciation (speculative asset)
3. Sell at profit or lose to foreclosure

### CLT Homeownership
1. CLT buys land ($300K) via grants/bonds
2. Resident buys house only ($200K vs. $800K market)
3. Monthly lease fee to CLT ($50-$150) covers land taxes
4. Resident builds limited equity (25% of appreciation)
5. On resale, CLT buys back at formula price; next buyer gets affordability

**Example Resale Formula (Burlington VT Model):**
- **Purchase price:** $200,000 (house only)
- **Market appreciation:** 10 years → $300,000
- **Resale price:** $200K + 25% of ($300K - $200K) = **$225,000**
- **Homeowner equity:** $25K gain + mortgage principal paid
- **Next buyer:** Gets house for $225K (still 50% below market)

---

## Governance Structure

### Tripartite Board (1/3 Model)
- **1/3 Leaseholders:** Current residents (elected by residents)
- **1/3 Community:** Local nonprofits, churches, unions (appointed)
- **1/3 Public:** Municipal reps, housing advocates (appointed)

**Why this split?**
- **Residents:** Ensure homeowner interests (maintenance, fees)
- **Community:** Preserve affordability mission (prevent speculation creep)
- **Public:** Align with local housing policy (zoning, tax credits)

### Decision-Making
- **Major votes:** 66% (bylaws, land acquisition, resale formula changes)
- **Routine votes:** Majority (budgets, staff hires)
- **Resident veto:** On lease terms (protects homeowners)

## Financing CLT Land Acquisition

| Source | Amount | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Municipal grants** | $100K-$5M | Cities with housing crisis (Vancouver, Toronto) |
| **Provincial affordable housing funds** | $500K-$20M | BC Housing, CMHC co-investment |
| **Community bonds** | $50K-$2M | Grassroots campaigns (3-5% interest, 10-year term) |
| **Philanthropy** | $100K-$10M | Foundations (Vancity, McConnell) |
| **Speculation tax revenue** | $90M/year (BC) | Phase 2 advocacy: Redirect to CLTs |
| **Wealth Fund (Phase 3)** | TBD | Post-2030 (Reset infrastructure) |

**Cost per unit:** $50K-$150K land + $150K-$300K building = $200K-$450K total (vs. $800K-$1.5M market).

## Resale Formula Options

| Model | Homeowner Gets | Next Buyer Pays | Pros/Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Appraisal-based (25%)** | 25% of appreciation + principal | Appraised value - 75% appreciation | **Pro:** Predictable. **Con:** Requires appraisals. |
| **CPI-indexed** | Purchase price + CPI inflation | Original price + CPI | **Pro:** Simple. **Con:** No wealth-building. |
| **Income-based** | 30% of next buyer's median income | Affordable to 80% AMI | **Pro:** Guaranteed affordability. **Con:** Complex calculations. |

**Best practice:** Appraisal-based 25% (used by 70% of US/Canadian CLTs).

## 18-Month CLT Launch Plan

### Months 1-6: Research & Coalition

1. **Assess Need:**
   - Housing affordability crisis? (Median home &gt;5x median income?)
   - Local support? (Municipal council, nonprofits, residents)

2. **Study Existing CLTs:**
   - **Canada:** [Québec City CLT](https://clttq.ca), Vancouver [CLT](https://cltrust.ca)
   - **US:** Burlington VT, Portland OR, Atlanta (adapt for Canadian law)

3. **Form Steering Committee:**
   - 10-15 people: Residents, housing advocates, union reps, lawyers
   - Meet monthly; assign roles (legal, fundraising, communications)

4. **Legal Structure:**
   - Incorporate as nonprofit (federal or provincial)
   - Draft bylaws (use [Grounded Solutions Network template](https://groundedsolutions.org))

### Months 7-12: Fundraising & Land Acquisition

5. **Campaign for Municipal Support:**
   - Pitch city council: "CLTs solve housing crisis without displacing current residents."
   - Ask for:
     - **Land donation:** Surplus city-owned lots
     - **Grants:** $500K-$5M from affordable housing fund
     - **Tax exemptions:** Waive property tax for CLT land

6. **Community Bonds:**
   - Crowdfund $100K-$500K from local residents (3-5% interest, 10-year term)
   - Use platforms like [REBL Bonds](https://reblbonds.ca) (Canada-specific)

7. **Identify Target Properties:**
   - **Criteria:** Underutilized lots, foreclosures, speculative holdings (e.g., Fidani/Pattison vacant land)
   - **Size:** Start small (10-20 units); scale to 100+ over 5 years

8. **Negotiate Purchase:**
   - Below-market deals (e.g., $200K/acre vs. $500K market)
   - Seller incentives: Tax deduction for donation; community legacy

### Months 13-18: Development & Leasing

9. **Build/Renovate Housing:**
   - **Partners:** Local unions (unionized labor), modular builders
   - **Timeline:** 6-12 months construction
   - **Cost:** $150K-$300K/unit (subsidized via CMHC, provincial funds)

10. **Market to Eligible Residents:**
    - **Income cap:** 60-120% AMI (area median income)
    - **Priority:** Current renters, displaced residents, essential workers
    - **Application:** Lottery if oversubscribed

11. **Close Sales:**
    - Residents buy house ($200K) with mortgage (via credit union)
    - Sign 99-year ground lease with CLT ($50-$150/month)

12. **Ongoing Stewardship:**
    - CLT monitors compliance (no subletting, resale formula adherence)
    - Provide homeowner education (maintenance, budgeting)

---

## Policy Advocacy for CLTs

### Municipal Level
- **Ask:** Donate surplus land; waive development fees; upzone CLT sites
- **Target:** Progressive councils (Vancouver, Toronto, Montréal)

### Provincial Level
- **Ask:** 10% of affordable housing budgets to CLTs ($500M/year in BC)
- **Precedent:** BC Housing's $19B fund (lobby for CLT carve-out)

### Federal Level
- **Ask:** CMHC co-investment in CLTs (low-interest loans)
- **Precedent:** US HUD funds CLTs; Canada should match

## Common Challenges (And Solutions)

| Challenge | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **Land too expensive** | Target foreclosures, city-owned lots; use speculation tax to fund |
| **Residents want full equity** | Educate on trade-off: Less equity, but no market risk + affordability for kids |
| **Municipal resistance** | Build coalition (unions, churches, residents); show fiscal benefits (no homelessness costs) |
| **Legal complexity** | Use template bylaws (Grounded Solutions); hire co-op lawyer |
| **Scalability** | Start small (10 units); prove model; bond for expansion |

## FAQs

**Q: Can CLT homeowners refinance?**  
A: Yes, but CLT must approve (ensures equity preservation). Most credit unions understand CLTs.

**Q: What happens if a resident defaults?**  
A: CLT buys back home at formula price; resells to next buyer. Resident keeps equity (if any).

**Q: Do CLTs work for rentals?**  
A: Yes—CLT owns land + building; rents at below-market (e.g., $800/month vs. $1,500). Called "limited-equity rental co-op."

**Q: Can I leave my CLT home to my kids?**  
A: Yes—CLT approves transfer (they must meet income cap). Or estate sells back to CLT at formula price.

**Q: How do CLTs prevent gentrification?**  
A: By locking in affordability permanently. Neighboring market homes may gentrify, but CLT units stay affordable.
