      <h2>Why Policy Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Grassroots action builds power through bank switches, union drives, and cooperative formation. But <strong>policy 
        locks in those gains</strong> at scale. Without legislative victories, your progress remains vulnerable. Big 5 banks 
        can deploy regulatory capture to block credit union growth. Provincial governments pass anti-labour laws like Alberta&apos;s 
        Bill 32, which deliberately weakened card-check certification. Worker cooperatives lack financing infrastructure because 
        Canada has no federal equivalent to America&apos;s Small Business Administration co-op loans.
      </p>

      <ResourceCallout type="info">
        <p>
          <strong>Reset Phase 2-3:</strong> Policy advocacy transforms isolated victories into systemic change. A <strong>1% 
          wealth tax</strong> on assets exceeding $10 million generates <strong>$5.6 billion annually</strong> according to 
          Parliamentary Budget Office 2025 estimates—funding sufficient for CLT construction, co-op development banks, and 
          citizens&apos; dividend programs.
        </p>

      <h2>Three-Level Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Municipal campaigns offer the easiest wins with shortest timelines.</strong> Progressive city councils in 
        Vancouver, Toronto, and Montréal respond to organized pressure within 6-18 months. Target vacancy taxes at 500% of 
        assessed value on properties vacant over six months annually, generating revenue for CLT funds. Push for land donations 
        of surplus city-owned lots. Demand living wage ordinances requiring $25 hourly minimum for city contractors. Advocate 
        for co-op zoning preferences that fast-track development permits.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Provincial campaigns require 1-3 years but unlock substantial resources.</strong> Focus on NDP or Green 
        governments—British Columbia and Québec show most promise. Expand BC&apos;s speculation and vacancy tax to Alberta 
        and Ontario. Restore card-check unionization with auto-certification at 55% rather than mandatory votes. Create worker 
        co-op tax credits and development grants. Implement wealth taxes at 1-2% on assets exceeding $10 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Federal campaigns demand 3-5 years but deliver highest systemic impact.</strong> Target NDP leverage during 
        minority government situations. Reform capital gains inclusion rates from 66.7% to 100%, closing the preferential 
        treatment for investment income. Crack down on offshore tax havens costing $3.65 billion annually in lost revenue. 
        Establish a Co-op Development Bank with $1 billion initial capitalization. Create a Citizens&apos; Wealth Fund through 
        2-3% financial transaction taxes on TSX trades.
      </p>

      <h2>12-Month Campaign Roadmap</h2>

      <h3>Months 1-3: Research & Coalition</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Choose one specific policy demand rather than diluting focus across multiple fronts.</strong> Your criteria 
        should balance high impact, winnability, and alignment with local political appetite. For example, expanding BC&apos;s 
        vacancy tax model to Alberta makes sense given housing crisis severity and existing precedent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Research precedents exhaustively.</strong> Which jurisdictions passed similar legislation? BC&apos;s speculation 
        and vacancy tax launched in 2018—study its implementation, revenue generation, and opposition tactics. Use Parliamentary 
        Budget Office and Canadians for Tax Fairness reports for cost projections. Identify who will fight your proposal—real 
        estate lobby groups, chambers of commerce—and prepare counter-arguments before they mobilize.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Build your coalition strategically across multiple sectors.</strong> Your core includes 99% Reset chapters, 
        union locals, and tenant unions. Allies should encompass churches providing moral authority, environmental groups 
        overlapping on fossil finance issues, and student unions mobilizing young activists. Recruit economists, lawyers, and 
        academics to provide expert testimony. Aim for 20+ organizational endorsements before launching publicly—this critical 
        mass demonstrates legitimate broad support rather than fringe advocacy.
      </p>

      <h3>Months 4-6: Public Education</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Frame your message through problem-solution-moral structure.</strong> Problem: &quot;Alberta has 15,000 vacant 
        homes while 4,000 people experience homelessness.&quot; Solution: &quot;A 500% vacancy tax raises $50 million annually 
        for affordable housing—proven effective by BC&apos;s SVT.&quot; Moral: &quot;Hoarding homes for profit while families 
        sleep in cars is fundamentally wrong.&quot;
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Deploy diverse communications tools systematically.</strong> Create a one-page PDF with statistics, precedent 
        jurisdiction, and clear ask—template formats below. Develop social media content including infographics, 30-60 second 
        videos, and personal testimonials from affected residents. Submit op-eds to major newspapers like Edmonton Journal 
        or Calgary Herald. Host 3-5 public town halls in union halls or libraries where supporters can ask questions and 
        build commitment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Launch a petition targeting 10,000+ signatures to demonstrate public support.</strong> Use platforms like 
        Change.org or LeadNow that provide infrastructure for signature collection, email follow-up, and data analysis. These 
        numbers matter when meeting decision-makers—a city councillor hesitates to dismiss a campaign backed by thousands of 
        constituents.
      </p>

      <h3>Months 7-9: Direct Lobbying</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Identify specific decision-makers with power to advance your legislation.</strong> Municipal campaigns target 
        city councillors, focusing resources on swing voters rather than certain opponents or guaranteed supporters. Provincial 
        efforts concentrate on NDP and Green MLAs while pressuring centrist Liberals vulnerable to constituent pressure. Federal 
        campaigns work through NDP caucus members and Liberal MPs in competitive ridings.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Execute lobby meetings with careful preparation.</strong> Book 30-minute appointments bringing 3-5 constituents 
        plus one expert—lawyer, economist, or academic. Your script follows a tight structure: introduce yourselves as voters 
        in their riding, present the problem affecting your families directly, propose the solution with evidence it works 
        elsewhere, and ask explicitly if they&apos;ll support it. Leave behind your one-pager, petition signature counts, and 
        coalition endorsement letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Prepare for committee testimony when bills advance.</strong> Public hearings provide official platforms for 
        your coalition spokesperson to present 5-minute testimony. Content should concisely state the problem, explain your 
        solution, and preemptively address opposition&apos;s likely concerns with data-backed rebuttals. This testimony enters 
        the official record, legitimizing your position.
      </p>

      <h3>Months 10-12: Mobilization & Vote</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Escalate pressure as the vote approaches.</strong> Organize rallies bringing 500+ people to city hall or the 
        legislature—visible demonstrations that decision-makers cannot ignore. Issue press releases and secure media interviews 
        amplifying your petition numbers and coalition breadth. Work your inside game: allied councillors or MLAs introduce 
        the motion or amendment you&apos;ve drafted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Track votes obsessively in the final weeks.</strong> Maintain a spreadsheet showing who&apos;s committed yes, 
        no, or undecided. Call undecided decision-makers daily with constituent stories. Pack the gallery on vote day—politicians 
        feel the weight of public observation. Win or lose, this vote identifies who supports transformative policy and who 
        protects the status quo.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Monitor implementation if you win rather than declaring victory and walking away.</strong> Governments frequently 
        delay enforcement or water down regulations during implementation. Sue if necessary—organizations like Canadian Civil 
        Liberties Association and tenant unions maintain legal resources for enforcing won policies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Municipal vacancy taxes deliver fastest results:</strong> 12-18 months from campaign launch to implementation, 
        generating $10-50 million annually in revenue while freeing 500-2,000 vacant units. Provincial wealth taxes require 
        2-3 years but produce $2-5 billion yearly, funding 10,000 CLT units. Provincial card-check restoration takes 1-2 years 
        and could unionize 100,000+ workers over five years. Federal co-op development banks demand 3-5 years but enable 1,000 
        new worker cooperatives by 2030.
      </p>

      <h2>Coalition-Building Best Practices</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Labour unions provide money, members, and political clout.</strong> CUPE, Unifor, and UFCW maintain substantial 
        political action funds and can mobilize thousands for rallies. Faith organizations including churches, mosques, and groups 
        like Kairos or Islamic Relief contribute moral authority that resonates beyond secular activist circles. Student groups 
        through the Canadian Federation of Students mobilize quickly on campuses. Tenant organizations like ACORN and Vancouver 
        Tenants Union bring directly affected constituents. Climate groups including 350.org and Council of Canadians overlap 
        substantially on fossil finance issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Offer concrete value to potential coalition partners.</strong> Co-brand all materials featuring both your logo 
        and theirs—this credits their contribution publicly. Divide labour strategically: unions handle rally turnout, students 
        manage social media campaigns, faith groups host community events. When you win, ensure everyone claims victory publicly 
        to build relationships for future collaboration.
      </p>

      <ResourceCallout type="warning">
        <p>
          <strong>Watch for red flags that undermine coalitions.</strong> Some foundations impose strings prohibiting support 
          for &quot;radical&quot; policies like wealth taxes—vet funders carefully. Maintain strict non-partisanship by 
          endorsing policies rather than parties—partisan alignment fractures broad coalitions. Resist mission creep by focusing 
          on ONE legislative demand per campaign cycle rather than diluting effort across multiple fronts.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <p><strong>Q: Should we target right-wing governments?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: Only if your issue has genuine bipartisan support—child poverty reduction, for instance. Otherwise, concentrate 
        resources on swing districts or wait for elections to shift government composition. Lobbying hostile governments wastes 
        limited volunteer hours better spent building power for the next election cycle.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: How do we counter well-funded industry lobby groups?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: They have money; you have people. Outnumber them at committee hearings, flood legislators&apos; phone lines with 
        constituent calls, and pack public galleries on vote days. Politicians respond to visible organized pressure more than 
        quiet lobbying checks—especially in competitive districts where small vote margins matter.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: What if we lose the legislative vote?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: Target those who voted no in the next election. Defeat opponents and elect champions. Losing votes still educates 
        the public about issues and builds organizational infrastructure for future campaigns. Many winning movements lost 
        repeatedly before breakthrough victories.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: Do we need lawyers for policy advocacy?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: Yes for drafting actual legislation—access pro bono assistance through law school clinics or union legal departments. 
        No for lobbying meetings or public education—those require political skills, not legal credentials. Know when each 
        type of expertise matters.
