      <h2>Why Unionize?</h2>
      <p>
        Unions fundamentally shift bargaining power from owners to workers. The economics are stark: unionized workers in 
        Canada earn an average of <strong>$5.40 more per hour</strong> than their non-union counterparts, according to 
        Statistics Canada&apos;s 2024 data. That premium compounds over a career into hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
        additional lifetime earnings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wage gap tells only part of the story. <strong>Eighty-five percent</strong> of union workers have access to 
        pension plans, compared to just 35% of non-union employees. Collective agreements prevent arbitrary firing, 
        transforming employment from at-will precarity into something resembling actual job security. Workers vote on 
        contracts and elect their own leaders—workplace democracy in practice.
      </p>

          <strong>The Reset Connection:</strong> Unions are Phase 1 infrastructure for economic transformation. A 10% 
          increase in unionization rates would redirect <strong>$50 billion annually</strong> from profits to wages, according 
          to OECD modeling. That capital starvation for speculative bubbles creates the financial pressure needed to fund 
          worker cooperative transitions in Phase 2.

      <h2>Legal Rights in Canada</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding your legal protections depends first on jurisdiction. <strong>Federal law</strong> governs roughly 10% 
        of Canadian workers in banking, telecommunications, the federal public service, and interprovincial transport. Under 
        federal jurisdiction, signing 40% of workers triggers a Labour Board-ordered vote, with victory requiring 50% plus one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Provincial jurisdiction</strong> covers the remaining 90% of workers, and rules vary significantly by province. 
        British Columbia offers auto-certification without a vote if you reach 55% card signatures. Ontario and Alberta both 
        set the threshold at 40% to trigger a mandatory vote, requiring 50% plus one to win certification. Québec grants 
        auto-certification at 50%. These differences matter tactically—you need to know your province&apos;s specific rules 
        before launching a campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Your protected activities</strong> include discussing unions during breaks and lunch, distributing materials 
        outside work hours, and organizing meetings off-site. Retaliation through firing, demotion, or discipline for union 
        activity is explicitly illegal. Employers cannot threaten to close or relocate, spy on organizing meetings, or promise 
        raises to stop organizing. These prohibitions have teeth: Labour Boards can order reinstatement with back pay and levy 
        substantial fines for violations.
      </p>

      <h2>90-Day Organizing Campaign</h2>

      <h3>Phase 1: Build Your Organizing Committee (Weeks 1-2)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Start by identifying natural leaders in your workplace.</strong> Look for respected, long-term employees with 
        social capital across different departments. Aim for 5-10% of your workforce—if you employ 100 people, recruit 5 to 10 
        core organizers. Diversity matters critically here: you need representatives from different shifts, demographics, and 
        job roles to build trust across the entire workplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Your first meeting must happen off-site and in secret.</strong> Meet at someone&apos;s home, a café, or a park—anywhere 
        your employer can&apos;t monitor. Discuss the fundamental question: why unionize? Identify your top three workplace issues. 
        Most importantly, commit to absolute confidentiality until you&apos;ve reached 30% card signatures. Going public too early 
        gives management time to mount an aggressive counter-campaign before you&apos;ve built sufficient support.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Contact a sector-specific union for institutional support.</strong> Unifor organizes auto, retail, and media workers. 
        UFCW focuses on grocery and food service. CUPE dominates the public sector. United Steelworkers covers manufacturing. These 
        unions provide legal expertise, training sessions, and official union card templates. Their resources multiply your capacity 
        dramatically—use them.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Card Campaign (Weeks 3-8)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Map your entire workplace systematically.</strong> Create a master list of all employees with their names, shifts, 
        and departments. Color-code each worker: green for supporters, yellow for undecided, red for opponents. Focus your initial 
        conversations on green and yellow categories—don&apos;t waste energy on committed opponents until you&apos;ve secured the persuadable middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>One-on-one conversations form the core of successful campaigns.</strong> Your opening should be simple and non-threatening: 
        &quot;Would you sign a card to vote on whether we want a union?&quot; Listen more than you talk. What&apos;s their top issue—wages, 
        safety, respect? Connect their concern directly to union power: &quot;A union gives us a voice to fix [their issue]. The card just 
        gets us a vote.&quot; Use official union-provided cards that require only a name, signature, and date.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Track your progress daily and aim for 60% card signatures.</strong> While most provinces require only 40-55% for certification, 
        employer pressure between filing and the vote typically erodes 10-15% of support. Building a cushion protects against this predictable 
        attrition. Update your workplace map after every conversation to maintain accurate intelligence on your campaign&apos;s trajectory.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 3: File for Certification (Week 9)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Your union files the collected cards with the federal Labour Board or provincial agency.</strong> The timeline moves quickly 
        from this point: boards typically order a vote within 5-10 days. In BC and Québec, reaching 55% or 50% respectively triggers 
        auto-certification without a vote—an instant victory if you&apos;ve built sufficient support.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Expect sophisticated opposition once your employer receives notice.</strong> Management will likely hire anti-union consultants 
        charging $10,000-$50,000 for union-busting campaigns. They&apos;ll hold captive-audience meetings where attendance is mandatory. Your 
        response should be calm and consistent: &quot;We just want a fair vote.&quot; Don&apos;t escalate confrontations—let their overreaction 
        demonstrate why you need union protection.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 4: Win the Vote (Weeks 10-12)</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Employer tactics follow predictable patterns, and so should your counters.</strong> When they claim &quot;we&apos;re a family,&quot; 
        respond that families don&apos;t fire you for being sick. When they say &quot;unions are outsiders,&quot; clarify that you ARE the union—leaders 
        are elected by workers, not imposed by some distant bureaucracy. When they warn about &quot;losing flexibility,&quot; point out that flexibility 
        currently means unpaid overtime and arbitrary schedule changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Get-out-the-vote operations matter disproportionately in close elections.</strong> Remind every supporter of the vote date, time, 
        and location. Offer rides to workers without transportation. Emphasize that the ballot is secret—no one knows who voted which way, so 
        anyone intimidated by management pressure can safely vote yes. Victory requires 50% plus one, and achieving it means you&apos;re 
        certified to begin bargaining your first contract.
      </p>

      <h2>After Certification: Bargaining Your First Contract</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Winning certification begins the real work of building union power.</strong> Start by electing a bargaining committee of 3-5 
        workers plus your union representative. Survey all members to identify top priorities—typically wages, benefits, seniority systems, 
        and grievance processes. Negotiation takes 6-18 months on average, during which employers must bargain &quot;in good faith&quot; under 
        Labour Code requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Strike authorization provides leverage even if you never walk out.</strong> Seventy-two percent of first contracts settle 
        without strikes, but holding a strike vote demonstrates worker solidarity and willingness to escalate. The final contract requires 
        ratification by membership vote—50% plus one approval. This democratic check prevents union leadership from accepting inadequate terms.
      </p>

      </ResourceStats>

      <p>
        <strong>Typical first contracts deliver substantial material gains.</strong> Expect 10-20% wage increases over three years. Benefits 
        packages expand to include dental coverage, pension contributions, and paid sick days. &quot;Just cause&quot; standards for termination 
        eliminate arbitrary firings. Written grievance procedures create formal channels to challenge contract violations. These wins compound 
        over time—a strong first contract sets the baseline for future negotiations.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <p><strong>Q: Can I get fired for organizing?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: No—it&apos;s explicitly illegal under federal and provincial labour codes. If an employer fires you for union activity, file an 
        unfair labour practice charge. Labour Boards have authority to order reinstatement with full back pay, plus penalties against the employer.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: How long does organizing take?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: Three to six months for the card campaign and certification vote. Bargaining your first contract adds another 6-12 months. 
        The total timeline from first organizing meeting to ratified contract typically runs 12-18 months.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: Do we pay dues before certification?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: No. Dues only begin after your first contract is ratified by membership vote. Typical rates run 1-2% of gross pay, which means 
        roughly $40-80 monthly for workers earning $40,000 annually.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Q: Can part-timers join the union?</strong></p>
      <p>
        A: Yes, and they often benefit most from unionization. Part-time workers typically face the worst pay, most unpredictable scheduling, 
        and greatest job insecurity—all issues that collective bargaining addresses directly.
