        <p>In an era of unprecedented wealth concentration—where Canada&apos;s 61 billionaires control $324 billion amid record inequality—the <strong>99% Reset movement</strong> proposes a non-violent strategy to redistribute power: a coordinated boycott of the <strong>Big Five banks</strong> (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC), which hold over 80% of retail deposits and financed $900 billion in fossil fuels since 2016.</p>
      </ColoredSection>

      <Highlight>
        <p>This paper expands on the mechanism: A targeted <strong>$10 billion deposit outflow</strong>—achievable through mass switches to <strong>credit unions</strong>—triggers credit rating reviews by agencies like Moody&apos;s and S&P, prompting investigations by OSFI and FCAC.</p>
      </Highlight>

      <p>These probes expose systemic risks tied to billionaire lending, fueling public and political momentum for <strong>wealth taxes</strong>, as evidenced by the NDP&apos;s 2025 platform (projected $94.5 billion over four years). Drawing on historical precedents like the <strong>Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956)</strong> and recent U.S. deposit runs (SVB 2023), this cascade can unlock <strong>$30 billion annually</strong> in progressive revenue, funding <strong>co-ops, CLTs, and Citizens&apos; Wealth Funds</strong>.</p>

        <p>Canada&apos;s financial system is a linchpin of inequality. The <strong>Big Five banks</strong> dominate with $6.5 trillion in total assets (Q1 2025), including $3-4 trillion in retail deposits, yet they enable wealth hoarding through low-wage financing and tax havens ($682 billion hidden offshore). Household debt hit <strong>$18.2 trillion</strong> in Q3 2025—higher than 2008 adjusted—as wages stagnate (-2.1% YoY real median).</p>
        <p>The <strong>99% Reset</strong> counters this via <strong>Phase 1: Starve the parasite</strong> through boycotts, targeting $10 billion in outflows (0.25-0.33% of Big Five deposits, per Forbes/StatsCan data). This isn&apos;t just a protest—it&apos;s a strategic intervention.</p>

        <p><strong>The chain reaction:</strong> Boycott → Rating Review → Regulatory Probe → Policy Momentum</p>

      <h2>1. The Boycott: Engineering a $10 Billion Outflow</h2>
      <JapaneseHeading japanese="ボイコット" english="Strategic Withdrawal" />
      
      <p>A bank boycott is not chaos but <strong>precision</strong>. Coordinated via #99ResetCA, participants switch deposits to ethical alternatives like <strong>Vancity</strong> or <strong>Desjardins</strong>, which grew assets 3.26% in Q1 2025 (FSRA data).</p>

      <ArticleCallout type="info">
        <p><strong>Historical precedent:</strong> The 1955 <strong>Montgomery Bus Boycott</strong> (381 days, 75% Black ridership) cost the system $3,000/day ($30,000 today), forcing desegregation via Supreme Court ruling. Economic pressure, not legislation, drove change.</p>
      </ArticleCallout>

      <p>By redirecting funds to <strong>credit unions</strong>, the movement builds parallel power while destabilizing enablers of the 1%. OSFI&apos;s Annual Risk Outlook (2024-2025) warns of "digitalization enabling abrupt outflows," as seen in <strong>SVB&apos;s 2023 collapse</strong> where $42 billion fled in hours.</p>

      <h2>2. Credit Rating Review: The Domino Effect</h2>
      <JapaneseHeading japanese="信用格付け" english="Market Signal of Vulnerability" />
      
      <p>Deposit outflows cascade directly to credit ratings. Agencies like <strong>S&P and Moody&apos;s</strong> monitor deposit betas (sensitivity to stress). A $10 billion hit flags "funding instability." The Canadian precedent: <strong>Laurentian Bank&apos;s 2022 near-failure</strong> (deposit flight amid pension shortfalls) led to a Moody&apos;s downgrade and swift OSFI intervention.</p>

      <ArticleCallout type="warning">
        <p><strong>Climate risk amplifies vulnerability:</strong> OSFI&apos;s B-15 climate guideline ties ratings to fossil risks. The Big Five&apos;s $131 billion in 2024 fossil financing (InfluenceMap) makes them especially exposed to scrutiny.</p>
      </ArticleCallout>

      <h2>3. Regulatory Investigations: Institutional Pressure</h2>
      <JapaneseHeading japanese="規制調査" english="OSFI and FCAC Mobilize" />
      
      <p>Credit rating reviews summon the regulators. <strong>OSFI</strong>, per its 2024-2025 mandate, probes "liquidity shocks" through on-site examinations. A $10 billion outflow breaches early warning thresholds, triggering formal investigations.</p>

      <p>In Canada, these probes will reveal uncomfortable truths: Big Five&apos;s <strong>uninsured deposits</strong> (~45%) and <strong>billionaire ties</strong>—like Thomson&apos;s $240M tax avoidance via Bermuda subsidiaries (C4TF 2025).</p>

      <h2>4. Policy Momentum: From Probes to Wealth Taxes</h2>
      <JapaneseHeading japanese="政策の勢い" english="The Political Cascade" />
      
      <p>Regulatory investigations catalyze legislative reform. Exposés of billionaire-fueled risks align perfectly with the <strong>NDP&apos;s 2025 platform</strong> (1% wealth tax on net worth &gt;$10M, projected $94.5B over 4 years). <strong>C4TF polling</strong> shows 89% public support for wealth taxes.</p>

      <ArticleCallout type="success">
        <p>In Canada, momentum peaks when the NDP leverages minority government power for budget insertions. PBO estimates a wealth tax would yield <strong>$11-13B annually</strong>. <strong>Projected yield: $30B/year</strong> (NDP model + loophole closures), funding <strong>Phase 2</strong> initiatives like <strong>10K CLT units</strong>.</p>

      <ColoredSection color="darker">
        <JapaneseHeading japanese="結論" english="Conclusion" />
        <p>A <strong>$10 billion boycott</strong> is the spark that lights the fire. It destabilizes credit ratings, unleashes regulatory probes, and ignites wealth tax momentum—transforming $324B in billionaire wealth into <strong>democratic assets</strong> owned by the 99%.</p>
